Diving right in!</p>\n<p>Rocking and rolling! Geospatial API endpoints, plotting places on a custom Google map, pushing user data to the API, displaying pages based on that user data … pretty exciting stuff! Maybe a little over-caffeinated here, which is having the effect of putting me to sleep, so I think it’s stir-fry time!</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Wow, okay, so stir-fry went great, <em>second tech interview</em> also went great! Solid maybe on this one! Definitely still getting used to video call interviews … like, would definitely rather meet inperson, it’s just so much easier with social cues, I have a hard enough time as it is, but while I was nervous, I knew what to <em>do</em> with the nervousness a little better … Alright, well tomorrow I have to hit the ground running again, I think I’m done-zow for today. Polish off advanced relationship population, advanced aggregation, and implementing pagination, then the deployment episodes, and I’m glad the series hits on Heroku a bit, that’s what this place I interviewed at was using … along with Python, PostGres … did I hear Django, or was I hallucinating? Definitely React Native, and Stripe, and Twillio, so that’s no worries, and it doesn’t sound like they were going to pay as much as like the last place I interviewed at, but getting paid was definitely on the table.</p>\n<p>Holy crap, the bass is <em>bumping</em> upstairs! They’ve been going since like 5, it’s like 7, and I’m just going to whistle along … what else can I do? I mean, it’s a Tuesday, who can blame them? Who would waste a Tuesday? We only live so long.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,\n~g</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: inline-block;\n    min-width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: inline-block;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-highlighted {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-background-color, transparent);\n    box-shadow: inset var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-width, 4px) 0 0 0 var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-color, transparent);\n  }\n  \n</style>","frontmatter":{"title":"Prayer For Campsinos","date":"April 21, 2020","description":"Interview at 6!
