I actually slept in a little today, latest all month at 7:30, I think I’m a little caught up though, and ready to rock and roll this coming week. Today, too, looking forward to seeing how much I can bust out today. Dawa did <em>not</em> want to go for a run this morning, not in this heat, and especially after I got him out on one yesterday in the evening, so I figured that meant I should go double, and busted out another half marathon. Yay! I think I should take Dawa out just briefly here, though, because it’s been a few hours. He just needs to experience that yes, it’s in fact bloody miserable out and that the A/C is our friend, lol. The temptation is also for my hips to lock up if I just sit right now, as much as I don’t want to do anything. I’ve got some of my buddy’s kombucha in me though, and that little kick, can definitely feel it! So tasty, too! Blueberry!</p>\n<p>// Alrighty, Dawa’s all set, I remembered where I put that markup I wrote for the next part on the home page …</p>\n<p>/// Uhh, well, got a little work in, my body informed me it needed to rest though, and whether I was on board with this just meant I was either resting on the sofa or passing out in my work chair.</p>\n<p>It was all work it to have some legit no-stress walks with Dawa. I’ll be waking up early tomorrow, without the need to do a major exercise, hopefully. Lord, I sweat buckets today. Allright, though, Dawa is fed and walked, I’ve had a curry, am exhausted, and am going to flip the little switch on my back to turn off. Big week ahead! Best wishes! ~g</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: inline-block;\n    min-width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: inline-block;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-highlighted {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-background-color, transparent);\n    box-shadow: inset var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-width, 4px) 0 0 0 var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-color, transparent);\n  }\n  \n</style>","frontmatter":{"title":"Obligate Adventuravore","date":"August 23, 2020","description":"In which Gareth gets it in in the heat!"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/obligate-adventuravore/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/cawfee-tawk/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Cawfee Tawk"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/order-of-operations/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Order Of Operations"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3786390493"]}
