It’s beautiful out, Dawa and I got a run in, and I’m going to work on Run Club for the web for a bit, because I want to. So there! :)</p>\n<p>Just learned that React Router and Reach Router are going to be combined, and that React Router is going to be the surviving product, but it’s going to have a new hooks-based API brought out in a minor release … //</p>\n<p>Ohhhkay, so, it’s somewhat later, and I’ve … what did I do? I’ve gone through the Auth0 single-page-app and API setup, which was new again since hooks and context became big, the code is so much cleaner, but I’m glad I’ve been using hooks and context for a little bit, or I’d have no idea what the heck was going on. Yay for the Node code being easier to read, too!</p>\n<p>The plan now is that I’m going to go with Mongo, so I can say I know the MERN stack, and people know what that means, and I can find plenty of content to learn it, and if I want to go back to Hapi and RethinkDB at some point, it can be to test perf, and that looks good, too. Uhh, anyway, the <em>slightly</em> larger picture is that I’m going to set up some UI prepping for a set of CRUD operations, then get the database going and test everything locally, then I’m going to learn how to use environment variables and nuke my git history so I can make the repositories (and that I’m working on them) public without giving out keys and privite IP addresses, all that good stuff, then I’m going to get the SPA up on Linode, get the A record and C-Name and nginx and node and all that jazz set up for trailcity.net, then I’m going to get the express server up, then the DB, test it all in prod, as it were, and then we’re off to the races. Set up a continuous integration flow, set a sprint up, and get to the continuously integrating!</p>\n<p>I’ve also got to sort through the job listings, and cook and do dishes and take care of the dog, and I’m going to set myself the reward of taking Dawa to the trail when I’ve applied to some jobs. Got down to the bridge on route to requisitioning supplies today, and took note of how wide the narrow parts of the pedestrian/bike path are, and I’m pretty sure I can get the trailer through, though I wouldn’t want to try it at speed, lol.</p>\n<p>Anyway! Next step, some UI! I should have a route for new runs (new adventures? I feel like it would be a missed opportunity not to abstract … T minus thirty to adventure time! 😆) and a route for runs where you could update and delete (and read.) I think Bumble’s got it down with the three tab thing right now. Aaanyway …</p>\n<p>Oh, wow, still not-so-much support for datetime-local in Firefox, Safari, or IE, I mean, IE no surprise, but it not being in Firefox or Safari … oh well, date and time work in Firefox and Safari, we’re going with that. And Formik, hooray!</p>\n<p>// I’m taking such small steps here, but steps they are! Oh boy … how do we use fetch? What sort of request am I making? How do I send a payload? What do I include in the fetch request to say what type the body is, and what do I include so that the server can parse it? We’re getting there, lol.</p>\n<p>Ohhh, I hate the new MongoDB stuff! I’m going to keep going for the reasons stated above, but wow, sold right out! I get it, there’s money to be made, they could have made the experience better though, like, I have to want to give you money, I don’t want you to try and trick me into it. Big oof.</p>\n<p>// About to help out a new developer in Los Angeles with some React stuff. Pretty stoked to be doing anything other than what I’m doing right now because I really don’t want to look at Mongo stuff any more right now. I go to the point where my Node app is listening for the client and talking to the Mongo instance and I’m about to try inserting some documents unless Patrick can please send me the video call link any faster, lol.</p>\n<p>// OOOOHHHHKAAAAY I JUST SPENT FOUR AND A HALF HOURS TUTORING SOMEONE, WHOA. GOODNIGHT.</p>\n<p>And best wishes!\n~g</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: inline-block;\n    min-width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: inline-block;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-highlighted {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-background-color, transparent);\n    box-shadow: inset var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-width, 4px) 0 0 0 var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-color, transparent);\n  }\n  \n</style>","frontmatter":{"title":"Easter Eggs","date":"April 12, 2020","description":"In which we inject a little joy into the day!"}},"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAUABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwABAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUCBP/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEA/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAHPRqeNNNR3TBKoH//EAB4QAAICAAcAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECABIDEyEiMTJB/9oACAEBAAEFAtxFZSNxnMSBjEN09TRP/8QAFhEAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAR/9oACAEDAQE/ASv/xAAXEQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARAR/9oACAECAQE/ATEKf//EAB0QAAICAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAiEQEUFhgaH/2gAIAQEABj8C0lD0s3GKLrkq+x4R/8QAHhABAAIBBAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARIRAxQVFhcZH/2gAIAQEAAT8hu4wNujMi6t704gHn6m+eCFHRmz6hRIOzREp+GHB6uf/aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQN/jC/8QAFxEBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAREP/aAAgBAwEBPxATG1PP/8QAGBEBAQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAQETH/2gAIAQIBAT8QTbg4m//EAB0QAQACAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESExQVFxobH/2gAIAQEAAT8QsDeVSlmyJDWEqhPrRsgQzseSHMpqNcy7RYcGZp4ECDXmKz7K9wgGkqEbK7L7Z//Z","width":50,"height":50,"src":"/static/59671f6cfe859bb1eddf927f56d7d289/99438/profile-pic.jpg","srcSet":"/static/59671f6cfe859bb1eddf927f56d7d289/99438/profile-pic.jpg 1x,\n/static/59671f6cfe859bb1eddf927f56d7d289/aba1d/profile-pic.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/59671f6cfe859bb1eddf927f56d7d289/b315d/profile-pic.jpg 2x"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/easter-eggs/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/life-at-the-train-station/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"C'Est La Vie En Gare!"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/continue/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Continue?"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1903139753"]}
