I just would rather have â€¦ well rather see the thing working again and then we can talk about backups. Dangâ€™d booting these things up and seeing the blinking file icon with a question mark inside. Yay itâ€™s going!</p>\n<p>Okay, and so while I wait on that and let what to do about this backup from 2016, I might have all of it in Google Drive already, am I going to search file by file? Why is it there?</p>\n<!-- Anyway, _while that marinates,_ I **met** someone today! I am super in work mode right now, but I'm **very** excited and hope to become very good friends with them! Deep breaths, though, and why didn't booting from the USB work, lol ðŸ˜ƒ -->\n<p>Why didnâ€™t booting from the USB work, lol ðŸ˜ƒ</p>\n<p>Oh, okay, the folder 250dump, thatâ€™s what that means â€¦ so if thatâ€™s backed up already â€¦ oh, and the USB did work, I just needed to run install, classic. Gooooood morning! Another cup of coffee is possibly called for. Iâ€™ve got to slim this drive down though, node_modules, media, all that â€¦ //</p>\n<p>Mmm, coffee. Handled some financial stuff, thatâ€™s off my mind now â€¦ oh, wow, good amount of stuff to delete â€¦ fastest <code class=\"language-text\">node_modules/</code> hunter in the East, lol â€¦ so I had 180gb used? How low can we go? Ohhh, itâ€™s still going, lol â€¦ took a shower, still going â€¦ weâ€™re at 731,514 deleted â€¦ okay, sweet â€¦ media on its way to being cleaned up â€¦ 159gb already though, thatâ€™s nice â€¦ nooo, being logged into the wrong wifi finally bit me! Thatâ€™s okay, just some time â€¦ oh, yay, go Google Drive uploader go!</p>\n<p>âœ¨ 155gb! âœ¨</p>\n<p>Wow, sooo much of that was node_modules folders. Crazy. Now letâ€™s try the backup thing â€¦ 21 minutes, cool â€¦ Iâ€™ll clean up some Run Club stuff â€¦ uhoh, are you frozen, Time Machine? Iâ€™ll give it to the top of the hour, lol.</p>\n<p>// Ahh, so frustrating! Iâ€™m about to say forget about Time Machine, and Iâ€™m just going to back everything I need to back up on cloud services and be done with it! One more try though, it says 104 seconds â€¦ the smell of my green tea fills my nostrils, the hair on my legs stands up, I straighten my back up ever so slightly â€¦ 38 seconds â€¦ luscious music plays in the background â€¦ 14 seconds â€¦ the tension is in the shoulders â€¦ wrists, neck, preparing backup â€¦ â€¦ what if saving this file while it said preparing backup broke it? What if â€¦ I deleted some stuff I wrote here, itâ€™s hard to get tone right in print, but I was going for a descent into madness type deal. Okay Iâ€™ll give it to 3:30, then Iâ€™m shutting it â€¦ JOY! What a rollercoaster day, lol, and now sadly Iâ€™m falling asleep at my desk and am going to bust a mission here â€¦ ehh, maybe in a minute, I want to keep going.</p>\n<p>Ooo, now I know the gist behind git-flow, yay, Iâ€™m going to use source control differently now! Iâ€™ve got the cheatsheet from <a href=\"https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/\">nvie.com/</a> in my folder! Thanks @nvie! Oh, wow, actually go follow him, thatâ€™s Vincent Driessen and heâ€™s got a lot of great work!</p>\n<p>Okay, <em>now</em> Iâ€™m going to get going, because itâ€™s saying the next automatic backup is in eleven minutes, so hopefully â€¦ know what, no â€˜hopefullyâ€™, auto backup off, Iâ€™m going to go and get beer before they wonâ€™t sell it (blue laws! Whoâ€™d a thunk?!) and weâ€™ll see if the file deletion is done yet when I get back! â€¦ ohh, I knocked the disk â€¦</p>\n<p>Supplies requisitioned, dog walked again, food on the stove for dog, and I really thought this Time Machine thing was going to happen but now Iâ€™m really not sure it is. My back hurts, and itâ€™s time to stop myself here. Tomorrowâ€™s Monday! Work-type things are expected to be happening! The proverbial hammer just fell, too, very exciting week! Ask me about it over coffee! For now!:</p>\n<p>Best wishes!\n~g</p>\n<p>P.S. Keeping on going, lol â€¦ must â€¦ get up and running â€¦ lol <em>everythingâ€™s</em> breaking now, this is crazy.</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: inline-block;\n    min-width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: inline-block;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-highlighted {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-background-color, transparent);\n    box-shadow: inset var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-width, 4px) 0 0 0 var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-color, transparent);\n  }\n  \n</style>","frontmatter":{"title":"Rainbows, Check ...
