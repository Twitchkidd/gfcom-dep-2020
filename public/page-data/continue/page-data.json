I’m going to jump right into it, because after spending four and a half hours tutoring someone in React last night, I feel like I need to race to get my place back here. I’d just … what did I do … set up Mongo? Yea, the server was talking to Mongo, I think I was halfway through how to update documents with the NodeJS driver … Oof, <em>one</em> step back though, I kept on having to look up how to do basic things and look up how class components looked, lol. Yay programming. Yea, as I close my tabs, this.handleChange.bind(this), what’s the syntax and where do you put it … How to use fetch to update state in a class component … Do we need to use super() or super(props) in the constructor … <strong>What are the attributes of an input, type ‘text’, lol</strong></p>\n<p>Okay, that one I think I knew, and was just showing them the docs at MDN. They were super smart, totally followed along with the concepts I was going over pretty quickly, brought correct terminology back around later in the conversation, and again, we were rocking and rolling for four and a half hours straight there, and you could tell they didn’t have a whole lot of experience with like, typing, much less the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, git, CLI, and React parts. I did my best, I really hope they do well!</p>\n<p>OKAY MONGO TIME, DO NO MORE PROCRASTINATING.</p>\n<p>Yay, I’m on fiyah this morning! 🔥 Also I feel like the Mongo driver docs just played me into Googleing, “What’s upsert?” … “Not much man, what’s up with you? (Says Sert)”</p>\n<p>Okay, sweet, tutorial time over, make stuff time. // Ooohkay, so I clearly need to restructure the routes and the connection, but I’m going to take a break, do some dishes, walk Dawa, and come back to this with a fresh mind.</p>\n<p>Oh, eff it, it’s @wesbos time. I can’t <em>really</em> afford this, but I can buy it, and I need a little boost right now. #learnNode!</p>\n<p>Okay, if my internet could come back, that would be great. … Thank you hotspot!</p>\n<p>// Dang, nature, you scary! It’s crazy out there, the busted gutter I told them about in Febuary got blown off the roof, the rain is coming in through the (closed) patio door, trees all gone cray, hod’dan’!</p>\n<p>Anyway, so I applied for five jobs today, and it was all <strong>terrifying!</strong> I ended up going back to the Node course, and I’m like a fifth of the way through. The templating language is weird! I guess pug/jade is popular, but whooaaa so weird!</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: inline-block;\n    min-width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: inline-block;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-highlighted {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-background-color, transparent);\n    box-shadow: inset var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-width, 4px) 0 0 0 var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-color, transparent);\n  }\n  \n</style>","frontmatter":{"title":"Continue?","date":"April 13, 2020","description":"In which Gareth puts another quarter in the machine!"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/continue/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/easter-eggs/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Easter Eggs"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/fore-dawns-early-light/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Fore Dawn's Early Light"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3786390493"]}
