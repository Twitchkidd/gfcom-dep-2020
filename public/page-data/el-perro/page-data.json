I‚Äôve been up since 5:30 and moving pretty optimally, Dawa and I got out for a first walk, then for a bike ride and trail run, and now we‚Äôre at the dog park and I‚Äôm about to finally be able to get some work in, I hope, lol. It‚Äôs just such an effort to be back to the house at 8 having biked miles across town towing him, and then dragging him on a trail run, which to be fair really is only until we get into the groove, then he does great, and his little paws are showing good texture, so the plan is working, but then I have to tow him back, get put together, and then he‚Äôs like in my face for more attention, and about at the end of my rope here, but there‚Äôs coffee at least, and hopefully I can escape into some headphones soon here.</p>\n<p>Okay, morning meeting with myself time, what‚Äôs on the docket ‚Ä¶ okay, got my files here, bio is partly deconstructed, layout is set up once I‚Äôm ready for CSS, working on index, up to Sidebar on mobile.</p>\n<p>Okay, here‚Äôs the last commit before main got rewritten <code class=\"language-text\">9bf4ca9b9470934b5063c70893bed3968d4fd0bb</code> ‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>Oh, lord, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on with the tabs. I forgot how crazy that was to set up. Okay, umm ‚Ä¶ DepNav, right, I renamed it. This thing needs wiring up a certain way, though. Back inside we get, working out here is too difficult ü§£</p>\n<p>Tabs has to encapsulate Tabs and Panels, and is where the state for the index of the panel lives. Tabs are buttons that get useTabState() for an onClick, and need to be wrapped with React.forwardRef. Something funky is going on with useRef there, too, I‚Äôm not really sure what. Oh, nevermind, I do, that focuses on the coding tab, I thought <code class=\"language-text\">codingRef</code> was related to something I was testing at some point.</p>\n<p>// Alrighty, had a snack I was getting hangry. I need to do some cooking here, there‚Äôs nothing really prepared and quick, so I made just the crudest cheese sandwich and got it down my gullet, lol. Closer to calorie-even today though. There‚Äôs some soup for later, and rice and beans to make, and I need to figure something to do with red lentils ‚Ä¶ anyway, back to React-land ‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>I really don‚Äôt like how the tabs are right now, component-wise, but I want to get the rest of this design more filled out here first.</p>\n<p>Hooof, mobile done, at least Index. I guess now would be the right time to wire up Layout ‚Ä¶ pheeew, done with the markup, for the moment. Doesn‚Äôt exactly build yet, though, definitely made up some variables and functions there. Wonder how many errors in the build tool ‚Ä¶ 13, NICE! 11! 10! Good enough for now, time to take Dawa out again!</p>\n<p>// <em>I just had to explain to someone that it was not Black people‚Äôs fault that they were enslaved. What. The. Fuck.</em></p>\n<p>‚Ä¶ MOVING ON. 8 errors. 6 errors.</p>\n<p>Hooof. It‚Äôs definitely coming along, pretty stoked, then my resume and personal website are both going to be pretty dope. I‚Äôm losing it a little here, though ‚Ä¶ maybe because I took a day off with Dawa yesterday, that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs so needy today? Okay, next steps here ‚Ä¶ branch from the old site so I can post these, and then the next time I‚Äôm in the code, I was just figuring out how to handle socials and filling all that info in, and the quote of the day, and then the header state management and invoking localStorage, and then the build should at least succeed, and we can be working with feedback in the browser! üèéÔ∏è</p>\n<p>Until tomorrow, be well and best wishes!\n~g</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: inline-block;\n    min-width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: inline-block;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-highlighted {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-background-color, transparent);\n    box-shadow: inset var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-width, 4px) 0 0 0 var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-color, transparent);\n  }\n  \n</style>","frontmatter":{"title":"El Perro","date":"August 07, 2020","description":"In which Gareth does the clickity-clack!"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/el-perro/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/index-and-layout-and-blog-post-oh-my/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Index And Layout And Blog-Post Oh My"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/proudfoots/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Proudfoots"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3786390493"]}
