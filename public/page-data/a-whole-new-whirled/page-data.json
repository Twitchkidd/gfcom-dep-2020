Woke up at 4 to get done what Iâ€™ve gotten done the past few days. Today was a quarter to 6 though, when Dawa alerted me to his need to go outside, and I hadnâ€™t heard that desperation in his tone for too long I guess and he pooâ€™d the rug, and somehow I didnâ€™t even realize leaving the place, I just threw some shoes on and harnessed him up, and came back to it being cleaning time. Poor little guy threw up later in the day, too. ðŸ˜¦</p>\n<p>Okay, well, coming to you from an apartment thatâ€™s like seriously clean right now and thinks to a certain set of windfalls, thereâ€™s <strong>food</strong> in the fridge! Stoked, for right now though, Iâ€™ve got to continue backing up the other machine. Next I have to set up the symlinks for my dotfiles, add in the terminal theme and put it in git, and â€¦ letâ€™s see, so Iâ€™ve got a repo in ~/Code thatâ€™s tracking et ceteral code things, but dots has its own repo, as do courses, demos, projects, teaching, tech-tests, and templates.</p>\n<p>Oof, stoked to possibly have a decent chair in the budget, I sit for like five minutes as of late and my back is totally killing me. I think I actually need to pivot to cooking mode and walking Dawa again here soon, but Iâ€™m pretty stoked for the next time I can sit, just like, not at the end of the day when Iâ€™m <em>least</em> able to support my spine properly, no beuno. Stoked for tomorrow morning, basically, and I have some new motivations in my life! Tell you about them over a bev, my Internet friend!</p>\n<p>Best wishes!\n~g</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: inline-block;\n    min-width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: inline-block;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-highlighted {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-background-color, transparent);\n    box-shadow: inset var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-width, 4px) 0 0 0 var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-color, transparent);\n  }\n  \n</style>","frontmatter":{"title":"A Whole New Whirled!","date":"May 20, 2020","description":"In which Gareth skips a day!"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/a-whole-new-whirled/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/strikethrough-before-dawn/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Strikethrough Before Dawn"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/hit-the-ground-running/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hit the Ground Running!"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3786390493"]}
