I forget what I did last time around to handle links doing that thing, and I tried the overrides from <a href=\"https://dev.to/joserfelix/how-to-make-a-static-blog-with-next-js-2bd6\">Jose Felix’s post</a> as is and they don’t work for my fonts, so a few little changes there and going back over the Gatsby site again, and then I’ve got a big-ole kanban set up with what I need to launch this thing, leh go.</p>\n<p>// Okay, so, let’s hear it for having multiple machines! I brought the main machine outside, and it was great, I could see, but it was like a brick out of an oven after a while, lol. Let’s hear it for git and the web, too, while we’re at it, git push, git pull, open the tabs I had open, bada bing, bada boom. Crazy.</p>\n<p>Being able to see was great though, oof, lol, bright out here in the morning! // Lol the sun also turned the backup machine into a small furnace, time for inside mode!</p>\n<p>Oh, yea, there’s that little bit of quirkiness in the text!</p>\n<p>Got through the footer content, on to header content … what a mess, the way this thing is organized is driving me nuts … That’s next on the digital todos, it’s physical todos time now! I’d love to go for a run, it’s beautiful out, but I really need to get a few things done around the house and when the place is put together, I have a phone call I need to get through, and I’m going to get groceries, do some meal prep, and get back to digital todos this evening! Love the progress so far!</p>\n<p>/// Wow okay, place is clean, phone call situation handled, tune in for part two tomorrow morning, lol, bunch of applications out while walking to/from groceries using the LinkedIn app, totally sent the wrong resume to the first company, and they looked perfect, whoops, but I also got the component hierarchy all mapped out and I can fix it now.</p>\n<p>Maybe a todo, the Next template uses a fragment instead of null, is this safer or something? Oh, apparently null is suggested by the React team … what’s with this then? Whatever, anyway …</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: inline-block;\n    min-width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: inline-block;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-highlighted {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-background-color, transparent);\n    box-shadow: inset var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-width, 4px) 0 0 0 var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-color, transparent);\n  }\n  \n</style>","frontmatter":{"title":"Cawfee Tawk","date":"August 21, 2020","description":"In which the coffee talks."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/cawfee-tawk/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/the-swing/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Swing"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["3786390493"]}
