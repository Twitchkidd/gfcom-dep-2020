It’s been a day, so far, but I need to jump right in, here. I got a Google Maps key to work with, went through the last video in the Geolocation section in the Learn Node series, and I looked at a few examples of how people used CRA and Express together, I think what I’m going to do though, to cement my knowledge, get something functional up, and get used to refactoring, and not have to galaxy-brain today because for whatever reason I’m just not filled with energy and creativity today, is to start up another branch of run-club-web where I basically remake it how Wes has Dang That’s Delicious set up at this point in the series, and then refactor it after that. Ready, set, go!</p>\n<p>Oh, you know what, I’m just going to rename it dep-run-club-web and make the git repo private, now I know how to use dotenv.</p>\n<p>// Oof, hours later! I think I’ve got everything in <em>relatively</em> minimalistically, just need to put the fonts in and get some icons going. And yes, I read the webpack config! Which I might not otherwise have, lol. Oh boy.</p>\n<p>Okay, so <em>now</em> it’s a job application party, or as my mother would’ve said, a partay. :) Made sure I got supplies, got some soup in, walked Dawa, fed Dawa, got some music going, drinks, snacks, aaand apply to jobs time! Aaand my Internet cuts out, nice :) … It came back :)</p>\n<p>// Well, I only tied the number of applications I put out yesterday, but several were from the ‘tier 1’ list today, and I spent extra time on them! Got back from the after chow-time walk with Dawa and our across-the-way neighbor was in handcuffs! Wonder what we missed.</p>\n<p>I have a good point to pick up again tomorrow, going to sign out for now and call it a night, stoked for an early day tomorrow though! Dawa and I had a day off from our runs, which have been getting longer, and I’ve been going for long enough here I know what a good next route will be!</p>\n<p>Best wishes!\n~G</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: inline-block;\n    min-width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: inline-block;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-highlighted {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-background-color, transparent);\n    box-shadow: inset var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-width, 4px) 0 0 0 var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-color, transparent);\n  }\n  \n</style>","frontmatter":{"title":"Application Partay","date":"April 15, 2020","description":"In which Gareth keeps it together!"}},"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":50,"height":50,"src":"/static/59671f6cfe859bb1eddf927f56d7d289/99438/profile-pic.jpg","srcSet":"/static/59671f6cfe859bb1eddf927f56d7d289/99438/profile-pic.jpg 1x,\n/static/59671f6cfe859bb1eddf927f56d7d289/aba1d/profile-pic.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/59671f6cfe859bb1eddf927f56d7d289/b315d/profile-pic.jpg 2x"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/application/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/fore-dawns-early-light/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Fore Dawn's Early Light"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/super-cereal/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Super Cereal"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1903139753"]}
