Almost got all the cleaning done that I wanted to yesterday, but I’ve got to get some work done here, but also, cleaning Dawa gets added to the list, I honestly don’t know how he got so dirty. Anywaay!</p>\n<p>Split my time … okay, I figure I’ve got like three good hours here, so the first hour will be <code class=\"language-text\">master-blaster</code>, the second RunClub, and the third my website? Let’s try it. Let’s also assume I started at 10, even though it’s 10:08, aaand here we go!</p>\n<p>Oh, I just remembered Polar Pairs … okay, 30 minute sprints, then, and I’ll throw updating my resume on the end there, and Polar Pairs in between <code class=\"language-text\">master-blaster</code> and RunClub, but I’m going to get a small bowl of cereal in, so we’ll call it 10:15 …</p>\n<h4><code class=\"language-text\">master-blaster</code>!</h4>\n<p>Okay, well wrapping that up took closer to 40 minutes, but yay, I was able to work on the code again and made things happen! Turns out I wasn’t actually checking users out of the branch they were on for local repos going through the remote process, so I didn’t need that, though the function I got from merfi on StackOverflow got a small modification to take in a path argument. Oh, snap, that doesn’t go to master automatically … huh … right, yea, stay in dev until later.</p>\n<h4>RunClub</h4>\n<p>Yo, I haven’t even run a React Native project on the new machine yet, this is bonkers. I bet there’s like new versions of everything and I’m not going to recognize any of the code, lol. React Native 63!</p>\n<p>Oohkay, everything is downloaded, let’s see how long Xcode takes until a basic install runs … oh, snap, I missed it, alright … okay, yeap, certificate process … ooo, packager! Computer is overheating, lol …</p>\n<p>OOOOHHHH THAT’S A BEAUTIFUL THING!</p>\n<p>Alright buddy, walk time …</p>\n<p>Hoof, okay, minorly productive day as far as dev stuff and administrative stuff goes, got the cleaning done in the afternoon, though! This place is <em>clean!</em> Like, there are a couple of places I could point to that could use further cleaning, but getting the patio done, getting the bathroom done, and getting the kitchen clean including the dish rack done, feels good, man.</p>\n<p>I’m not sure how Dawa is going to be here, and whether he’s going to continue to need attention and totally wear me out or if I’m going to get an evening session in, here.</p>\n<p>Nnno, I feel the tiredness washing over me. Stoked that react native apps build and install maybe five to ten times quicker on the new machine, saving like five minutes at build time. That’s crazy. Whatever magic this architecture is doing, programs on the command line and everywhere else run significantly faster than on the other machines. I guess that’s what eight years of engineering will do, lol. Yay! Tomorrow let me see if I can’t get up early again, I got up earlier than I did yesterday today, but missing that magic early bird window of creativity. I feel like how many days a week I hit the flow state by 5:30 is a sign of how much I got done that week.</p>\n<p>I don’t have it in me right now, though, I don’t even have the energy to cook. Hope y’all are well out there, back tomorrow, best wishes!\n~g</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: inline-block;\n    min-width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: inline-block;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-highlighted {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-background-color, transparent);\n    box-shadow: inset var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-width, 4px) 0 0 0 var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-color, transparent);\n  }\n  \n</style>","frontmatter":{"title":"Bike Ride!","date":"July 14, 2020","description":"In which Dawa is a good boy!"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/bike-ride!/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/master-blaster-v1!/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Master Blaster V1!"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/footpad/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Footpad"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3786390493"]}
