Oof.</p>\n<p>Okay, not really sure where to jump in today. There’s more auth stuff to tidy up, or I was thinking of seeing what libraries were out there to handle search in React Native, since I really have no idea where I’d start there … I mean, I guess you just have the list of things, and display a FlatList, and then onChangeText you filter for ones that include that string? Huh, actually, I could do that. Maybe. Let’s see. How about I go over the auth thing one more time, maybe there will be some low hanging fruit and I can get my fingers flying, and then we try the search thing, and then I was thinking, since it looks like the Instagram API is on total lock-down these days, it might be prudent to see if I could write a node service that hits instagram.com/{user-name} and whether pulling the profile pic in would be feasible. Which is spelled <em>f-e-a-s-i-b-l-e</em> … gotta see about a spell-checker in this thing. Oh well.</p>\n<p>Aaand yelling tweaker outside my window. Great.</p>\n<p>Aaand navigation options have stopped working entirely. Can’t header none, can’t change the header title even. What. // Now it works after deleting and reinstalling the app. Yay. Half an hour later … // Oop, it’s back. Why.</p>\n<p>RNDebugger: Network tab, DISABLE CACHE!!! //</p>\n<p>Alrighty, much later. Mental health somewhat rejuvenated, got Dawa for a brief run, then got one in myself, had some soup, made coffee, took Dawa out again, back to it here. Listened to the <a href=\"https://devchat.tv/react-native-radio/rnr-160-react-native-at-shopify-with-ryan-christiani/\">React Native Radio podcast with Ryan Christiani</a> at Shopify, what was pretty dope. I downloaded that as soon as I saw it, since I’d just worked with some of their embedded code on the Lyme Art Association, which waaas … yea. A learning experience, for sure, and also definitely a confidence booster, seeing it live on the Internet, even through the rest of the site is still … it still needs work, but that’s something they can find a budget for or live with :)</p>\n<p>Where were we? I just found out that you <em>can</em> pass callback functions through route params, but the yellow box yelled at me for it, so that’s a question mark, and then building out the business selection page.</p>\n<p>Ahh, small things eat my time! That’s part of it, though, and part of why I’m so bad at estimating how long something will take :\\ Like, why is this simple CenteringView component making everything nearly invisible? And then so, my phone is much faster than the simulator that runs on my laptop, but the cord doesn’t like to stay connected, so it’ll lose connection every time I shake it to pull up the debug menu or reload it. Bleurgh. Let’s try the simulator … // Oh, this <em>sucks!</em> The simulator is running just too slowly, like, the keyboard just doesn’t want to load up, I’ve got to try the device again. Or maybe hack on Android … because the iPhone 6 simulator was working okay at least, but with Xcode 11, I’d have to download it, and my Internet still isn’t installed and I’m out of high-speed hotspot. Ahh!</p>\n<p>Okay … hitting debug reconnects everything, I’m getting fast updates, I’m not getting build errors for the moment, got styled-components up and running … huh, weird, nothing in the Formik component reacted to KeyboardAvoidingView, though the text above it did. Oh well, I don’t need that right <em>now</em> … and maybe it’s just that the whole thing needs to be one component.</p>\n<p>Oof, where do we leave off today? Heard from Oluwatobitowa, he’s just been busy, good to know he’s okay, and I’m about to expand into more React Native stuff, server stuff, hopefully figuring out context and react-navigation very soon, I’m going to work hard to bust out something that will hopefully be useful for Dave and co. and something to put on the resume, going to take Monday for paperwork/admin stuff because <em>everything</em> is crazy right now, good night though aaand:</p>\n<p>Best wishes! ~g</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: inline-block;\n    min-width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: inline-block;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-highlighted {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-background-color, transparent);\n    box-shadow: inset var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-width, 4px) 0 0 0 var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-color, transparent);\n  }\n  \n</style>","frontmatter":{"title":"Why Will Semicolons Be Everywhere In The Coming Months?","date":"March 28, 2020","description":"Because they're always after math."}},"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":50,"height":50,"src":"/static/59671f6cfe859bb1eddf927f56d7d289/99438/profile-pic.jpg","srcSet":"/static/59671f6cfe859bb1eddf927f56d7d289/99438/profile-pic.jpg 1x,\n/static/59671f6cfe859bb1eddf927f56d7d289/aba1d/profile-pic.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/59671f6cfe859bb1eddf927f56d7d289/b315d/profile-pic.jpg 2x"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pandemic-humor/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/terrapin/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Terrapin"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/early-day-in-the-neighborhood/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Early Day In The Neighborhood"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1903139753"]}
