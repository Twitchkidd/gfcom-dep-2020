For a second, though, imagine you find out that people didn’t tell you that your enslavement was supposed to be over <strong>TWO YEARS AGO.</strong></p>\n<p>Just like, what the fuck.</p>\n<p>First thing I was going to do was fix the sound in this game I’m working on, but I forgot I haven’t changed over my git branch names yet. Today’s the perfect day for it.</p>\n<p>Oh, boy, okay … so this is not a reason to not do it, obviously, but I’m going to have to clone every repo on my github and change each branch. I want to write a script for this … first fixing what branch a git repo inits with, thanks <a href=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/EasilyRenameYourGitDefaultBranchFromMasterToMain.aspx\">Scott Hanselman</a> for <code class=\"language-text\">git config --global alias.new &#39;!git init &amp;&amp; git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/main&#39;</code> and the rest of the article!</p>\n<p>Oof, this machine is so slow. I don’t really want to open it up and switch the ram out though, like I don’t think I would mess it up, but if I did I wouldn’t have a computer for a few days, and I don’t want that, lol. There was a tweet recently about the American dream being to use a computer to make enough money to never use a computer again … I dunno, man, I really like using a computer. At least when things are going well, lol. I don’t have to look to type, I don’t need my fingers to leave the keys to do things, I don’t get bored … meh, anyway …</p>\n<p>New shell function for new git folders! I need to figure out how to stop prettier from stripping whitespace from my mardown files to paste it in, though, which I should have done a while ago, lol, but I’ve had two cups of coffee and need to go for a bike ride :)</p>\n<p>// Beuno, coffee beans and an HDMI cable acquired, monkey brain quieted, standing desk configured, dog … dog got a short walk in, he’s going to have to wait until later for a longer one. He keeps on trying to go over to where we used to live, which is really not kosher dill … he’ll get there. I’ve got to do this thing, though. Wish I had a backyard, mais c’est la vie.</p>\n<p>///</p>\n<p>Hoohhhkay! So! A) Had an adventure with Dawa, he’s definitely taken care of, exercised, socialized, and ate well, and B) I’ve got all of my repos cloned, which was kinda step one there because the process is to clone the repo, rename master to main, push, then change the default branch on github, then delete the remote branch, and I spent some time getting my python environment better set up because I want to write a script so I don’t have to use github.com 56 times (lol, too many repos, but down from 68! Unintended good side effect!) which might actually be faster at this point, but if I make a script for it to just change all of your repos to main, BEUNO! Then I can share it and help making the world a more inclusive place easy! (Which is what developers like, we’re lazy, except when we’re the opposite of lazy :) That’s a tomorrow thing, though, I almost succumbed to heat exhaustion again today, for the second time in a week!
