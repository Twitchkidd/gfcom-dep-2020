Up early and got Dawa on a bike ride, didn’t make it for the full run when we got to Stenger, though. I have to give him an anti-anxiety pill today and get his grooming in, that’s on the docket. Also, it’s time to clean the apartment again, somehow. That, and it’s virtual garage sale time! Mmm, also have a phone call or two, but here’s the real news story:</p>\n<p>I’ve got a coding challenge as part of an interview process!</p>\n<p>So stoked, about to set myself down to give this a shot! Two questions, JavaScript, no frameworks, just logic, half an hour!</p>\n<p>// Okay, sweet! I was able to do it with 8 minutes left, which probably means I should’ve taken 8 minutes to refactor, lol. Whew! Definitely had that moment, when the tests failed on the second question, of “oh no, oh no nothing works, oh jeez” but pushed through! Cool site, too, Hacker Rank, I’ll have to go back when I’m in application mode again. I wonder how legit it is. Huh, legit.</p>\n<p>Alright, then, I’m going to go on a mad cleaning/handling-physical-stuff dash here to deal with the stress and get the rest of the day going! ///</p>\n<p>Whew! Laundry folded, vacuuming done, sofa de-dusted, bike cleaned up, dishes done, dog bathed, brushed, nails done, and I’ve got rice and beans on the stove right now. Mmm. Also, yay, responded to someone on LinkedIn who reached out, updated my resume there …</p>\n<p>The layout is just about ready to be filled out. Siesta time, though! I don’t know how a workout is going to fit in, though, my ankle is really feelin’ it today.</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: inline-block;\n    min-width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: inline-block;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-highlighted {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-background-color, transparent);\n    box-shadow: inset var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-width, 4px) 0 0 0 var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-color, transparent);\n  }\n  \n</style>","frontmatter":{"title":"New Challenger!","date":"August 11, 2020","description":"In which Gareth takes on logic!"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/new-challenger!/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/mr-sandman/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mr. Sandman?"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/challenging/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Challenging"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3786390493"]}
