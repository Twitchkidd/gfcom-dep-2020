I‚Äôm not having a great mental health day, but I‚Äôm here at the park with Dawa, he‚Äôs just chillen, not really though because it‚Äôs hot with 100% humidity. I‚Äôve got to get a little work done or I‚Äôm going to go absolutely nus, though. So, let‚Äôs write some CSS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶ because CSS is the &lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; frustrating languages ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;///&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoops, didn‚Äôt write for a while! I got some administrative things done today that I‚Äôd been meaning to do, blew a bunch of lines of CSS out and got some structure ready for a push early tomorrow, and Dawa got as much outside time as we could manage, with the heat. I was pretty low yesterday and earlier today, I‚Äôm looking forward to the future again though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if I forgot to push a commit on the other machine, the file names I changed haven‚Äôt changed on this one ‚Ä¶ Nope! Weird! Why? Glad it‚Äôs case-insensitive and just works, but dang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaanyway, good luck out there, best wishes,
~g!&lt;/p&gt;

Up early and got Dawa on a bike ride, didn‚Äôt make it for the full run when we got to Stenger, though. I have to give him an anti-anxiety pill today and get his grooming in, that‚Äôs on the docket. Also, it‚Äôs time to clean the apartment again, somehow. That, and it‚Äôs virtual garage sale time! Mmm, also have a phone call or two, but here‚Äôs the real news story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve got a coding challenge as part of an interview process!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So stoked, about to set myself down to give this a shot! Two questions, JavaScript, no frameworks, just logic, half an hour!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Okay, sweet! I was able to do it with 8 minutes left, which probably means I should‚Äôve taken 8 minutes to refactor, lol. Whew! Definitely had that moment, when the tests failed on the second question, of ‚Äúoh no, oh no nothing works, oh jeez‚Äù but pushed through! Cool site, too, Hacker Rank, I‚Äôll have to go back when I‚Äôm in application mode again. I wonder how legit it is. Huh, legit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, then, I‚Äôm going to go on a mad cleaning/handling-physical-stuff dash here to deal with the stress and get the rest of the day going! ///&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whew! Laundry folded, vacuuming done, sofa de-dusted, bike cleaned up, dishes done, dog bathed, brushed, nails done, and I‚Äôve got rice and beans on the stove right now. Mmm. Also, yay, responded to someone on LinkedIn who reached out, updated my resume there ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The layout is just about ready to be filled out. Siesta time, though! I don‚Äôt know how a workout is going to fit in, though, my ankle is really feelin‚Äô it today.&lt;/p&gt;

It‚Äôs super hot out! Also, still not a whole lot of that sleep thing going on! I‚Äôm sure I hit REM at one point, because I was dreaming, I think that‚Äôs how it works, right? Anyway, my brain knows it‚Äôs on this side of a night‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ rest, at least. I‚Äôve got a plan, though, the plan involves me getting some work done here, though, so let‚Äôs hop to it. Dawa is taken care of, though he thinks he wants another walk right now. We went out on the patio for a little bit, we definitely don‚Äôt want a walk right now. Got to Harkness today, since I ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to call it ‚Äúsleeping‚Äù in, but I didn‚Äôt get up until six thirty today, which, accounting for a first walkies, means that twenty minutes from when we start biking is eight o‚Äôclock, when Harkness opens. I really prefer it if I‚Äôm not really up for technical single-track trail, which today I‚Äôm really not, still recovering from running around with my niece after a pretty decent trail run with Dawa on Saturday, plus the like, not so much with a rest or a break, and the plan for moving forward is to add another run/workout in in the evening ‚Ä¶ wish me luck, lol!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, website time. It rendered, which is nice feedback to get when you spend, you know, whatever it was, eight to ten hours between design and authoring, that you aren‚Äôt totally off your rocker as far as markup and rendering logic go. I wonder if I should approach the CSS from an inside-out or outside-in perspective? Like, I could start with the small components and then when it‚Äôs time for the whole thing‚Äôs layout, it‚Äôll have that wow factor, or I could start with the outer layout and drill in, promising speed but the temptation to not get to the polish ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh man, falling asleep standing up, that‚Äôs no good, lol. I just drank coffee. Great coffee, actually, thanks to my wonderful sister! I just remembered, from earlier actually, I was pushing Dawa up the first hill out of here this morning and I almost fell asleep walking. ‚Ä¶ Okay, fixed the Gatsby Link components, they just needed ‚Äò/about‚Äô or whatever, not the whole url.// Got myself together, I‚Äôm falling asleep standing here. I think I‚Äôm going to bust a quick mission, try to get a nap in, and then give it another shot here. Just going to add a few things to AppWrap that I thought of in the shower though ‚Ä¶ oh, the custom paddings and everything for that funky look the old layout had, that can go now, yay, lol! I‚Äôm glad that‚Äôs in the git history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;/// Next day, post-mortem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ooohkay, so that ‚Ä¶ kind of worked. I did get a nap in, got up, made herbal tea, took Dawa to the park for a bit, and I did go for a run, but I was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; able to get any work done afterwards, just too tired still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, to the future, best wishes,

I got like an hour and a half of sleep last night, and the coffee definitely has not hit yet, but my day light was set for earlier than yesterday, I‚Äôm up, let‚Äôs do this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huh, I thought I fixed photos ‚Ä¶ oh, wow, my Gatsby config file is &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; messed up, there‚Äôs nested plugins declarations. I don‚Äôt know how it builds at all, lol. Good job, Gatsby, and Gareth, what the hey? Okay, I need to prioritize, though, omg and Dawa just stretched lying on his side he‚Äôs the cutest ‚Ä¶ ahem! Prioritize! Gatsby config file gets turned into an issue, let‚Äôs get this React written. Go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, no, Dawa is awake and needs attention for the next two hours, lol. Effff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;/// Okay, yea, handled. Woof. I don‚Äôt know what I did, but images are back up. Posts with images, so far, if you want to catch up ‚Ä¶ not sure how long images hasn‚Äôt worked, lol:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ayy, applied for a job! I hope they get back to me! Ooo, and the person I emailed said they would pass my name along to someone they know, very exciting! Yay for not appearing outwardly crazy to the other people at the dog park, lol!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two jobs! Ha! What‚Äôs the next thing to work on, I need to get the laundry in, myself together, and Dawa outside for a bit. Might work from the dog park. Headers logic. This may be overkill for a button, it‚Äôs going to be awesome though, if it works out, I‚Äôm so stoked if I can pull this effect off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Okay, Dawa walked, albeit briefly due to the heat, laundry should be done soon, and let‚Äôs see how close we are to this thing rendering ‚Ä¶ query in blog-post template ‚Ä¶ uh-oh, I fixed a few things and it built. I wonder how awful it looks right now, lol. Oh, sweet, now the errors are just showing up at run time. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;socials.map&lt;/code&gt; isn‚Äôt a function, cool, can handle, forgot that‚Äôs an object, not an array, wrong data type&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oooh, that was confusing, it was telling me data was undefined for the default export of index.js, but the actual problem was that I was importing { Image } from gatsby rather than Image from gatsby-image. I saw a flash of bi pride before it collapsed this time! How exciting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OH WOW! Guys! Guys come quick! It rendered! It‚Äôs so awful lollll!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs rendering though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, lack of sleep has caught up to me. I‚Äôm going to do everything I can to stay up another few hours here and make sure Dawa has enough outside time ‚Ä¶ except for drink more coffee. I had two cups today, and I think going off my caffeine schedule yesterday may have contributed. Also I got just way too excited to see my sister and her fam, and then had an emotional breakdown at like midnight, lol. I was going to say maybe I‚Äôll get more work done today, but I know when not to push myself, at least sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes y‚Äôall,

Got Dawa out on a trail run again this morning, just having my second cup of coffee before putting myself together, and I really want to solve the header problem really quick because I was thinking about it trying to fall asleep last night, but really quick, I just saw this commit message, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Add a footer so that content does not abruptly end&lt;/code&gt; and that makes so much sense!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so MoreLessButton is going to be floating between the headers, meaning it‚Äôs going to be absolutely positioned and needs to know how many headers are open at the time, and then if the user closes any headers, start saving state to localStorage so they don‚Äôt have the headers open next time. Forgot to mention check if there‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ what are we calling this ‚Ä¶ headersCount? headerCount? Names are hard! Okay well it‚Äôs counting headers, but you count pages, too, but you don‚Äôt say pagesCount, you say pageCount, it‚Äôs implied by count that page may be plural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;headerCount&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, lordie, just went down the FP rabbithole for a while. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/javascript-scene/curry-and-function-composition-2c208d774983&quot;&gt;Currying and Function Composition by Eric Elliot&lt;/a&gt; Then my back said no more sitting. I took Dawa to the park for a bit, I‚Äôm trying lying prone and seeing if I can do that. I just read a compelling argument for not just combining state and using the functional version of setState with a spread operator, recommended in the docs and all that. I think that refactor is going to have to be for tomorrow, though, I‚Äôm zonked. The alarm is set for earlier, let‚Äôs see if I can get Dawa ran and coding before 8! If there are dogs at the park when we get out from the trail-run, though, it‚Äôs going to be 8:30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tifme to wind down, though, peace and &amp;#x3C;3, best wishes,

&lt;h4&gt;Footer .. heh ..&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title and description are references to Lord of the Rings, the movie, first in the trilogy, not sure exactly why that bit came to mind, but I don‚Äôt have these sorted by date, and having a memorable name is the only way I can find it quickly. Eyes are weird.&lt;/p&gt;

I‚Äôve been up since 5:30 and moving pretty optimally, Dawa and I got out for a first walk, then for a bike ride and trail run, and now we‚Äôre at the dog park and I‚Äôm about to finally be able to get some work in, I hope, lol. It‚Äôs just such an effort to be back to the house at 8 having biked miles across town towing him, and then dragging him on a trail run, which to be fair really is only until we get into the groove, then he does great, and his little paws are showing good texture, so the plan is working, but then I have to tow him back, get put together, and then he‚Äôs like in my face for more attention, and about at the end of my rope here, but there‚Äôs coffee at least, and hopefully I can escape into some headphones soon here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, morning meeting with myself time, what‚Äôs on the docket ‚Ä¶ okay, got my files here, bio is partly deconstructed, layout is set up once I‚Äôm ready for CSS, working on index, up to Sidebar on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, here‚Äôs the last commit before main got rewritten &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;9bf4ca9b9470934b5063c70893bed3968d4fd0bb&lt;/code&gt; ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, lord, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on with the tabs. I forgot how crazy that was to set up. Okay, umm ‚Ä¶ DepNav, right, I renamed it. This thing needs wiring up a certain way, though. Back inside we get, working out here is too difficult ü§£&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tabs has to encapsulate Tabs and Panels, and is where the state for the index of the panel lives. Tabs are buttons that get useTabState() for an onClick, and need to be wrapped with React.forwardRef. Something funky is going on with useRef there, too, I‚Äôm not really sure what. Oh, nevermind, I do, that focuses on the coding tab, I thought &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;codingRef&lt;/code&gt; was related to something I was testing at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Alrighty, had a snack I was getting hangry. I need to do some cooking here, there‚Äôs nothing really prepared and quick, so I made just the crudest cheese sandwich and got it down my gullet, lol. Closer to calorie-even today though. There‚Äôs some soup for later, and rice and beans to make, and I need to figure something to do with red lentils ‚Ä¶ anyway, back to React-land ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really don‚Äôt like how the tabs are right now, component-wise, but I want to get the rest of this design more filled out here first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hooof, mobile done, at least Index. I guess now would be the right time to wire up Layout ‚Ä¶ pheeew, done with the markup, for the moment. Doesn‚Äôt exactly build yet, though, definitely made up some variables and functions there. Wonder how many errors in the build tool ‚Ä¶ 13, NICE! 11! 10! Good enough for now, time to take Dawa out again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// &lt;em&gt;I just had to explain to someone that it was not Black people‚Äôs fault that they were enslaved. What. The. Fuck.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶ MOVING ON. 8 errors. 6 errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hooof. It‚Äôs definitely coming along, pretty stoked, then my resume and personal website are both going to be pretty dope. I‚Äôm losing it a little here, though ‚Ä¶ maybe because I took a day off with Dawa yesterday, that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs so needy today? Okay, next steps here ‚Ä¶ branch from the old site so I can post these, and then the next time I‚Äôm in the code, I was just figuring out how to handle socials and filling all that info in, and the quote of the day, and then the header state management and invoking localStorage, and then the build should at least succeed, and we can be working with feedback in the browser! üèéÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;

Somehow it‚Äôs still morning! I was up early today, got Dawa out, and then instead of taking him for a bike ride I went for a long run, which my legs were kinda not ready for, but I started back up after a walking break and made it home, then worked in the park a little with Dawa hanging out with his buds, he was pretty chill, I took him for an afternoon run yesterday on top of his usual morning run, which included socialization and sprints yesterday. I thought about what I needed to do with the code on the run today, now I just need to bust this out. Pen and paper time, though, I was looking at it at the park and I think I know the todo list I need to make, but concentrating there was less than ideal, due to nearby construction and being right on the, albeit relatively quiet, road, so now I‚Äôm back inside and Past-Me left Future-Me (and Dawa) air conditioning, thanks Past-Me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now on with the show!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs how it looks at the moment:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, sweet, dude, I didn‚Äôt even notice that I broke the whole little tabs thing I had going on there. Yyyea, site overhaul long overdue. Mobile was never really even accounted for except for what came with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gatsby-starter-blog&lt;/code&gt; ‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs wrangle this spaghetti monster in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bio takes in location, then if it‚Äôs root it returns a fragment with either a wrapper with an Image and a p tag with a links saying follow me on Twitter or hire me, lol, or a ‚Ä¶ slightly differently styled wrapper with an Image and a p tag with a link saying follow me on Twitter. Info about the author and the Twitter account, as well as the source of the Image, come from a useStaticQuery call. Bio is rendered as the first non- react-helmet component inside Layout from index.js, and inside a footer in blog-post.js, right above the navigation. Inside Layout. ü§Æ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Index takes in location and data from a page query, then it ‚Ä¶ oh, how sad is that greyed-out import statement up there, I meant to do something better for mobile, lol. Okay, well, it returns Layout with location and a title that comes from data, then the whole home page, passing the whole data object through to BlogList, in the coding panel. It used to handle state regarding tabs, I don‚Äôt know what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving on to blog-post, which takes in location, data, and pageContext, and returns a Layout with location and title (from data,) Seo with stuff from data, which I realize I hadn‚Äôt mentioned in the previous paragraphs, but they were there, and an article and nav, populated with data and pageContext, also including Bio in the article, with location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Layout, which imports Global, and takes in location, title, and children, then checks if location is root before defining Header as either a LandingHeadingWrapper with an h1 with the title, and the hamburger, or an h3 with the title, then it returns a fragment with Global, then checks if location is root and either LandingMainDiv or OtherMainDiv with the same contents, a header tag with Header, a main tag with children, and a footer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶ so what we &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; is ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay Bio dismantled, for starters, just need to not lose the ‚Ä¶ the location part only gets used one, but the graphql query needs to be in index and blog-post, the Twitter thing will be handled elsewhere, and soak up the looking for work part in a GitHub issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Index then needs to take that graphql query in, and then make a media query, and then, to layout, pass either one set or another of things already spelled out in ./index.html. Also, all of the markup that makes up the homepage should live here, not in Layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blog-post should have Bio taken out, and the graphql will have to be added to the useStaticQuery, and also should make a media query. I think? It looks like the Typography module is making it‚Äôs own media query, though it isn‚Äôt doing much with it. Should either review its scale and rhythm functions or switch to something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last Syntax FM with lobotomized owl CSS, that one might be good to listen to for the next revamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay so then &lt;em&gt;Layout&lt;/em&gt; needs to make it‚Äôs location check if it‚Äôs root or not and then we need to add a media query, because at least with the homepage, we‚Äôre going to be rendering different content that needs to be wrapped accordingly. Layout can contain the wrapper components, as well as global, but the homepage‚Äôs components should be moved to index.js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Ooohh, I just typed so much! And there‚Äôs more to do! I‚Äôm glad I got organized first! I‚Äôm going to keep going here for a little bit, a few nights of bad sleep have caught up with me, though, and I can feel the end of my daily productivity approach. My eyes droop, etc. Just back from a walk with Dawa and the juices are flowing, for the moment, so let‚Äôs go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dog is being so distracting. Everything is being so distracting, though. I don‚Äôt appear to have the energy to filter things out very well and not get emotional about noises. Really tried to continue my productivity, if I don‚Äôt turn the A/C on and try and reset my brain, here, I‚Äôm going to have a conniption, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm working on &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; like an absolute fool, so today‚Äôs post will probably be up tomorrow? Anyway, best wishes!

Dawa and I got out on a bike ride to Stenger Park after our first walk again today, and he got to run around with some huskies after running the trail with me, and we‚Äôre ready to work at 9:15 here, and he‚Äôll be good for a long while today, so not bad. I‚Äôm drinking some cold brew made with a blend specifically made for it, it‚Äôs crazy good. I haven‚Äôt had black iced coffee that tasted &lt;em&gt;sweet&lt;/em&gt; like that, I don‚Äôt think ever, this is really some good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up is Reactifying this layout, and since my build broke and I suspect just like, everything needs updating, I‚Äôm going to start from a new templete and build the site up from that again. Just like with React Native, it‚Äôs often better just to blow the project away and start again, with all the dependencies that go into these projects. One of the nice thing about Python, that a lot was built in, but I was doing different stuff with it, and it‚Äôs great that web technologies can evolve so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Eugh, okay, third walk, &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; we‚Äôre good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gosh, yea, I checked the build files, it seems to just be a versions thing. Images working just fine when I copy my blog content over to the starter, for some reason it just isn‚Äôt pointing to the file in /static ‚Ä¶ oh, /static isn‚Äôt being populated with any of the remark-images stuff at all. Ooohkay moving on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right, so most of the base stuff is copied over, now we‚Äôre at the part that makes my head explode every time. There‚Äôs index, which is obviously special, and then there‚Äôs blog-post, the template, and both take in the Layout component, and then so the Layout component needs to be aware of it‚Äôs location and split into different parts, so yes, start here, and also remember that if you need any more templates or pages ‚Ä¶ oh, and 404 has it‚Äôs own thing, too. And credits. ‚Ä¶ and also, Layout takes in children, as well as location and title, and creates the markup for the header based on location. üçù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh sweeeet, just needed to check gatsby config and make sure everything was valid and -gatsby-plugin-sharp was loaded first!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Phew, got Dawa on another run around the block, champion of a little guy he is, then I got some groceries, got a chicken in the oven, back at it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yaaay thanks Shelly for the re-Tweet! Shelly‚Äôs the best. Looking forward to showcasing some of her art in a side project!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, let‚Äôs get this thing done. The hard part really is that the degree of how convoluted the setup is, it‚Äôs like a black hole sucking my attention in. I need some sort of diagram. Pen and paper time. Now I know at least the build isn‚Äôt totally pooched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Werd, so now I‚Äôve looked through it and taken paper notes, and now &lt;em&gt;I‚Äôm&lt;/em&gt; pooched, and this whole operation is going to have to start tomorrow morning. Hopefully here‚Äôs a picture of a dog!&lt;/p&gt;

Dawa got a bike ride, some socializing with other dogs, a short run in, and I‚Äôm good to go at 9am, yay! Yesterday we needed another walk afterwards, and I had things to do around the place, not today though! Onward!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First project is the resume, which will be a snap because I spent the time breaking up what needs to change into issues, so let‚Äôs see ‚Ä¶ I bet I can be done before 9:30. Let me go ahead and double that, though, unless I‚Äôve learned nothing about how good I am at estimating how long a task will take. 10:00, and if I‚Äôm not done by then, I‚Äôve got to clean the bathroom. It needs doing at some point here, it‚Äôs not like horrific or anything, but I‚Äôd rather not, so how about that‚Äôll be the consequence if I don‚Äôt. Except I‚Äôm going to do one or two things here and then clock in for an hour from whenever that is, because it‚Äôs been a couple of minutes already and a part of my brain is saying no fair, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so the strategy is going to be to set the timer for 15 minutes and switch to standing ‚Ä¶ 9:15, go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, shoot, I need to speed up, it‚Äôs been 15 minutes already? Go go go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Well, I got a lot done, having the right amount of pressure is a wonderful thing, guess who‚Äôs cleaning the bathroom though. ü§£&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dawa and I are at the park now, it‚Äôs really nice having a backup machine dedicated to working outside and moving either around the apartment or wherever else I might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Alrighty! V4 of the resume! It‚Äôs got a repo now, too! And I have a PNG of it, and that‚Äôs definitely going up on the website, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs accessible somehow, but now it‚Äôs like ‚Ä¶ ohhh, man, if I loaded it in from GitHub, I could always have the most up-to-date version ‚Ä¶ do like, one more change then ‚Ä¶ sweet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up is the layout, let‚Äôs see ‚Ä¶ I think I had gotten through the markup for mobile, but wasn‚Äôt done with the markup for desktop ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweet, got that figured out, time to switch to CSS mode! Ehh ‚Ä¶ actually, I mean I went to spin up a stylesheet.css, but that‚Äôs one of the nice things about &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;styled-components&lt;/code&gt;, I can do the Reactifying first, and then write scoped CSS. The next thing to work on is whether I‚Äôm going to nuke this thing or not, so seeing what the latest scaffolding for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gatsby-starter-blog&lt;/code&gt; is ‚Ä¶ hmm, okay so just looks like updating to the v2 versions of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gatsby-remark-images&lt;/code&gt; and anything else in the build step will probably do it, though I wonder what the scaffolding looks like now anyway ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, thanks Elsbeth! My sister caught that I hadn‚Äôt paid any attention to the months field in the resume. She suggested deleting it, I‚Äôm on the fence about it based on how nicely it ties the sections together when the consistency issues with caps, and slashes and dashes was fixed.
Okay, markup for desktop complete, Reactify, then style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until tomorrow, best wishes!

I didn‚Äôt sleep all that well last night, but through the power of routines am somehow ready to rock and roll here, put together, the dog is wiped out from a run and is happy to have gotten a bike ride in, and I found a nice place to position one of my corkboards so I can have the notes from two and three days ago up, which was when I discovered that Past-Me had left me a note to ‚ÄúPlz gfcom-p-h thx.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶ Well, then. Obviously meant something there ‚Ä¶ and then it dawns on me that it‚Äôs gfcom-public-html which I‚Äôve been meaning to do a diff of the commits between builds for like ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I‚Äôve got this ‚ÄúQuiet Hours‚Äù playlist going, and there‚Äôs this kinda hypnotic track playing, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git diff HEAD^ HEAD&lt;/code&gt; was scrolling by in the terminal, and something must have been minified, because a lot of comma-seperated seemingly random five- or six-character strings were going by, for like a while, and I was thinking the scene where he‚Äôs looking at the code and seeing the Matrix, and I kind of zone out for a second waiting for it to finish catching up on the scrolling so I could exit and refine the diff to just give me files, and it switches to words and phrases, and for just a moment there I was like, oh, my God, it‚Äôs happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not, that was plain English in markdown files, the diff was just scrolling through another file. Maybe someday Neo, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git diff --name-only SHA1 SHA2&lt;/code&gt;, thanks ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòPeter‚Äô on StackOverflow. In there with that name, nice. Wonder who that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh my God ‚Ä¶ this is his bio, I kid you not, ‚ÄúI am not actually called Peter. Sorry about that.‚Äù Hundred and six thousand reputation though, focus on git and then Ruby and Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alrighty, sweet though, it‚Äôs index.html, the folder with the blog post name, index.html in that folder, the folder in page-data/ of the blog post name, page-data.json in that folder, and rss.xml. I‚Äôll script that when I‚Äôve got it in me to deal with string functions. I need a break from string functions. Let‚Äôs see if this works, though ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TESTING ‚Ä¶ Hooray! Much better than selecting all files and folders in and ftp GUI and then &lt;em&gt;unselecting&lt;/em&gt; the ones you don‚Äôt want deleted. Honestly I think I lost a folder at some point along the road here, lol. cgi-bin/, did I need that? I hardly ever look at the Apache stuff on the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm going through a bag of light roast at the moment, which is not the freshest, it‚Äôs pre-ground, but at least it‚Äôs a light(ish) roast, and was on sale. I‚Äôm not sure whether I want another hot cup of that or a cold cup of a coffee marketed as good for cold brew that my sister gave me, (thanks Elsbeth, we‚Äôll talk soon!) but I think I‚Äôll keep letting the A/C do it‚Äôs thing and go for the hot coffee, in the hopes that Dawa will really not need atention for a while if at least it‚Äôs cool in here. AWW he just went and found a blanket to snuggle up in, bless his little heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, coffee made, back to it, I need to do other things right now, but TODO on scripting that last thing up, and ready set go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huh, well known dev tool Anaconda‚Äôs website is broken from 768px width to 991px. I‚Äôm throwing no stones here, to be clear, my website is broken at any device width, just funny to see the web being broken sometimes. Oh, no, it‚Äôs their enterprise page too, not just their individual page. Oh well, I get the feeling anyone who‚Äôs maybe an Anaconda customer would understand about browsers if they were using a tablet in that range. Time to eat the frog, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yay, frog eaten! There was an email I was hesitating tackling, but I made myself an outline and handled it. Phew! Weight of ye olde shoulders, ya know. And uhh, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.noisli.com/what-it-means-to-eat-the-frog/&quot;&gt;link to ‚ÄúEat The Frog‚Äù,&lt;/a&gt; an approach to getting things done. (Apparently named for a Twain quote, who knows.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.noisli.com/what-it-means-to-eat-the-frog/&quot;&gt;As Mark Twain once said ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs your job to eat a frog, it‚Äôs best to do it first thing in the morning. And if it‚Äôs your job to eat two frogs, it‚Äôs best to eat the biggest one first.‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, moving on, this one job wanted Pandas, so maybe I‚Äôll just learn that real quick. That‚Äôs the attitude you‚Äôve got to have, the title of the posting looks perfect, but the first line they need Pandas, I mean, how hard could it be? We‚Äôre coding, right? Let‚Äôs do this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHOA Anaconda is cool! Oh, sick, also the icon overlays the Android Studio logo to give you this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/// Oof, that turned into a whole adventure. I‚Äôm exhausted. To pick up from before, first resum√©, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; Pandas, oh and also, how many animal names can I stuff into my resum√©? Python, Pandas, Anaconda ‚Ä¶ oh, there are less than I was thinking, at least among the easily googleable ones. &lt;em&gt;Total&lt;/em&gt; aside though, there‚Äôs a &lt;a href=&quot;pythonforbiologists.com&quot;&gt;pythonforbiologists.com!&lt;/a&gt; Interesting! I miss mathy stuff like this! Okay, exhaustion is setting in, bon soir and best wishes! ~g&lt;/p&gt;

One of the tires for Dawa‚Äôs trailer got a puncture and I don‚Äôt know what I might have done with a patch kit, but since it‚Äôs like 6:30, looks like no bike ride till later, buddy, lo siento! I don‚Äôt have it in me to just run him right now, either, I‚Äôm pretty beat, still recovering from the half marathon a couple days ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs nice and cool out at the moment, Dawa looks like he doesn‚Äôt mind that I‚Äôm not schlepping him across town for a run, and I‚Äôm enjoying the patio before the sun blasts me too much here, lol!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, tech-wise, yea, so, current project is this website‚Äôs layout and just everything, because oof, and then job-wise, still need to polish the resume, write a CV, and then I have to see what I did last time that worked to get me to pump out applications. Also on the tech-todo, try and find someone from the Python community who might help out with at least the packaging problem with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;master-blaster&lt;/code&gt; ‚Ä¶ not problem, really, I mean, the program works, it packages up just fine, just you need to install the dependencies yourself, and it‚Äôs not bad, there‚Äôs only two and they‚Äôre pretty common, still though, there‚Äôs got to ‚Ä¶ oh, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;requests&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of code, oh interesting reading ‚Ä¶ time to go in though, the sun is roasting me and my back is hurting from looking down at the screen, as I‚Äôm not sure where an extension cord with three prongs might be, otherwise I‚Äôd have the second screen and the stand out here, todo though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Yea, my body said I was not going to be sitting/standing still looking at a screen for a while, lol. I had to lie on my back for a while and do stretches and then Dawa decided we needed another walk, so I put myself together and we got around the block. Got through that, got some soup and tea in, Dawa‚Äôs brushed, next step ‚Ä¶ next step is to finish this paperwork job I‚Äôd started. Very close to being organized, official papers-wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh what have I been doing for a few days though? Got to the doctor, that was awesome, oh, right, and I worked on the design for the website and wrote out a lot of markup, that was a thread to pick up on. Papers first, though. My floor was like totally covered in mail and the like early yesterday, can‚Äôt wait to see the place tidy again. Really, really missing caf√©s, too. I hardly ever get as much done as when I‚Äôm there and would just feel really guilty doing anything but working intensely, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Yaaas, I now have a spreadsheet with the subject and location of all of my official papers. I don‚Äôt have a concrete plan on tackling it, thinking something like decide everything is going to be handled by a certain time, divide by that many days, and make a little randomizer script on what to deal with that day. Feels good to have a spreadsheet though, and I was able to throw some stuff out. Emotionally draining ‚Ä¶ :\ ‚Ä¶ keep going, though! We‚Äôve just gotten started and it‚Äôs going to be so good! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, finished the second half of writing the markup for the new site design, exciting, next up is styling.&lt;/p&gt;

Dawa got a mile around the block this morning, then I got five and a half barefoot, did some solid design work on the next version of garethfield.com, and got my work stuff sorted out from my personal stuff, except for small notes, paperwork-wise, and now I‚Äôm going to see what I can do about implementing this layout. I‚Äôm pretty stoked, I made some considerations for mobile that I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing come alive. Let‚Äôs see if I can bust this out, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going with the Chakra UI library for a little visual polish, so far so good ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, nevermind. I want to work with just html/css and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;styled-components&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react-template&lt;/code&gt; time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh wow! I hadn‚Äôt looked at the code I‚Äôd written for this Gatsby site since I whipped it up in ‚Ä¶ March? March. Lol I looked at the git log rather than the last post on the posts list, which never got paginated or anything lolll just been crankin‚Äô! I put so much love into it, at the time, but it just really is not how I‚Äôd set things up if I were to do it over right now. Also I think the build broke, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;/// Whoops, didn‚Äôt tie this up! Life happens y‚Äôall, best wishes! ~g&lt;/p&gt;

So I definitely messed the whole master-blaster program up, again, then I fixed it I think, but‚Ä¶]]></description><link>https://www.garethfield.com/ahh!/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.garethfield.com/ahh!/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jul 2020 11:51:06 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Good morning! Oh jeez, what a day so far! So I definitely messed the whole master-blaster program up, again, then I fixed it I think, but there‚Äôs still a little bit to iron out. Fortunately, Dawa is cool just chillen for a while, since we got a nice trail run in, and I‚Äôve had a second coffee, so let‚Äôs do this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eugh, okay, the clone command is throwing a warning that needs to be handled, what else ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, lol, so what I broke, mainly, was if localDirectories was turned on, it would check the repo if it had a local directory, or if localDirectories was off, then it would check all repos, but I didn‚Äôt have the else statement set up for if localDirectories was turned on and there was no local directory. Whooopsie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, why is the rm temp dir command not running properly? And why is it running push ‚Äîdelete origin master? And why is locallyBlastIt being cloned?! Ahh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohhkay, so if the remote is set with, say, ‚Äòtwitchkidd‚Äô rather than ‚ÄòTwitchkidd‚Äô with the capital T, the string check to see if there‚Äôs a local copy of a repo fails!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Omg I think I did it! Yes! It all works!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// And I wrote out a contributing doc at the dog park!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we‚Äôre settling for having to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;pip install questionary&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;requests&lt;/code&gt; in order to run it for now, at least it‚Äôs pip and not pipenv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it‚Äôs on PyPi! Please nobody have gotten anything lower than v1.0.6, lol! Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so that was task 8 from yesterday, and then there‚Äôs just the last one, to get the word out about it! 9: Tweet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lol, I‚Äôm reaching for the command line because I‚Äôm still in the mode of working on &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;master-blaster&lt;/code&gt;, but a) going to twitter.com is much easier, and b) done with working on &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;master-blaster&lt;/code&gt; for a while! Almost a little bit of shock, like, wow, really, done for now, there‚Äôs the version upgrade on pypi.org. Crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yea, wow, okay, Tweeting, it‚Äôs happening, I sent out like seven messages in bottles ‚Ä¶ ooh, TerminusDB said it ‚ÄúLooks great!‚Äù Wow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, other than being glued to Twitter, I‚Äôm done with this type of thing for the day, I‚Äôm wiped! It‚Äôs cooking time, about to make some soup, rice, beans, and figure something out with red lentils!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes! ~g&lt;/p&gt;

I just got all the todos to get this thing to like an acceptable state on paper, here, and Dawa‚Äôs been run, he‚Äôs chillen, let‚Äôs do this! I‚Äôm going to title the sections what I wrote on the sketch pad:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1: Tell if it‚Äôs local&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did this one, check. I wasn‚Äôt sure I was running the script from the project or from pip, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;print(&amp;quot;hey&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt; did it though. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2: [List of changes to the text]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2.01: Warrantee/Specify GNU 3+ at least&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lol first of all, GNU General Public License v3 or later (GPLv3+), good try, then currently, we see:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that‚Äôs an improvement at least. The license calls for implementing show w and show c for displaying the warranty ‚Ä¶ and ‚Ä¶ copying ‚Ä¶ and oh my goodness, I spelled warranty &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; off when I wrote it down just now, ‚Äúwarrantee‚Äù? Lol, we‚Äôll just leave that in, but so I decided to go all the way in this direction for the warranty and intro text:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2.02: master-blaster version in logfile.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just in case anyone happens to still be using pre-1.0.5, so then their logfiles won‚Äôt have it, and may be why they‚Äôre having problems, apologies. Shouldn‚Äôt have been anything too major, I hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beuno. The intro also looks beautiful now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2.03: Switch log/Gihub notice, First:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeap, first part I did, changed the username prompt to have First at the front of it to be like ‚Äúreally, this is the starting point of the application.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2.04: Confirm GitHub username&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with the primary verb good. More question marks bad. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;questionary&lt;/code&gt; is already adding question marks to every line after a prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;?
First, please enter your GitHub username!&lt;br&gt;
Twitchkidd&lt;br&gt;
? Confirm GitHub username: Twitchkidd (Y/n)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better! Ooo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;?
First, please enter your GitHub username!&lt;br&gt;
Twitchkidd&lt;br&gt;
? Confirm username: Twitchkidd (Y/n)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beuno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2.05: rm parens from repotypes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, yea, I‚Äôm logging the option chosen, and right now the whole string includes an explanation that collaborator/organization updates are still in development. Okay, fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2.06: too many lines for local ask&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs true. Too long. But all of that was critical info, so it‚Äôs two three line groupings now rather than one five line block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2.07: rm middle sentence projects q&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmmm, what did I mean ‚Ä¶ Oh, that‚Äôs probably okay to stay, actually. Moving on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2.08: rm first part of token q, whitespace&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yea, the token question really needs tidying up. // Phew, that took a little doing. Got a link to the docs in there, looks more balanced ‚Ä¶ oh yea!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;?
‚Äî Get a token! ‚Äî&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since password-based token generation is being deprecated,
please get a personal access token with the correct scope(s)
to run this program!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get this token, go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt;https://github.com&lt;/a&gt;, sign in,
then go to ‚ÄòSettings‚Äô, then ‚ÄòDeveloper Settings‚Äô,
then ‚ÄòPersonal access tokens‚Äô, then ‚ÄòGenerate new token‚Äô,
confirm your password, name the token in the ‚ÄòNote‚Äô input field,
select the public repo scope, then ‚ÄòGenerate Token‚Äô,
and then copy it to your clipboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please save it somewhere first in case there‚Äôs an error!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more thorough (and visual) instructions in the GitHub docs,
see the personal access token part here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/2X0cr3j&quot;&gt;https://bit.ly/2X0cr3j&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paste it back here into the prompt and hit enter to continue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2.09: git branch is being printed&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, processLogger updated ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2.10: git alias printing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeap, processLogger updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2.11: switch thank you and log&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice. All the copy is tidied up, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3: Local master delete logic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, switch languages, this is a problem with my Python, not my English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohh, that was a hack, lol, I really should have taken the time to refact it to an array, but instead I just made another parameter secondIgnoreStr=&quot;&quot; lolll. Hopefully won‚Äôt need to go too much further there! ü§£&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ooh, git alias is still printing, actually, my hubris bites me on the butt for not testing 2.10!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed fixed fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4: rm dir logic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yea, running rm -dfR on anything unecessarily is no beuno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dope, needed to be handling error states with that process anyway. One more global variable, but no biggie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, and then that‚Äôs it then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5: Directories test&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is where I need a repo to be in each of the following states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already has main, has master - External main conflict. (Seems the case could be made based on defaults as to whether to delete remote master.)
Already has main, doesn‚Äôt have master - Already blasted.
Already has main, doesn‚Äôt have master, and there‚Äôs a local with main and master - Local master delete.
Doesn‚Äôt have main, has master, default is master - Blast it.
Doesn‚Äôt have main, has master, default is master, and there‚Äôs a local - Locally blast it.
Doesn‚Äôt have main, has master, default isn‚Äôt master - Default not master conflict.
Doesn‚Äôt have main, doesn‚Äôt have master - Who.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside ‚Ä¶ why is it still checking collaborator and organization repos? Oh, I‚Äôve messed it all up, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes, ~g&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, it‚Äôs a) okay, but also b) not great right now. The dev branch is on Pypi. Whoooops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JK though on all that work being gone though! Yay!&lt;/p&gt;

I can‚Äôt recall at the moment whether I finished up two days ago‚Äôs post, or if I even made one. Pretty sure‚Ä¶]]></description><link>https://www.garethfield.com/floor-space/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.garethfield.com/floor-space/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jul 2020 15:52:19 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Good afternoon! What a few days! I can‚Äôt recall at the moment whether I finished up two days ago‚Äôs post, or if I even made one. Pretty sure I didn‚Äôt finish up yesterday‚Äôs post. Sometimes an official sign off isn‚Äôt possible. C‚Äôest la vie. (‚Ä¶ la vie!) :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, today my morning‚Äôs moment of creative genius went to the processLogger function, then I fleshed that out a little and am ready to test the processes, also I have the Python extension for VS Code open on the other machine, and there‚Äôs this wild thing called Jupyter that they suggest, so I‚Äôm checking that out, it‚Äôs like if you could just slap some Python into your Google Doc, but with extra crazy sprinkles on top for visualization, and the whole application is both super nice for features and easy to share stuff with, and also not just Python but like a whole bunch-ton of languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ooo! Also, I used an access token for the Strava API from Python and it worked! V. excite! I‚Äôve been naming my runs specifically with this moment in mind for the past several years! Literally!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the run is named like ‚Äú4mm Merrells‚Äù, so just a specification of shoes/barefoot, I was alone, and 4mm Merrells vs 2mm Merrells just means Trail Gloves vs Vapor Gloves, and barefoot is always ‚ÄúBarefoot‚Äù and then so if Dawa is with me, it‚Äôll always be named like ‚Äú2mm Merrells with Dawa‚Äù or ‚Äú4mm Merrells pushing Dawa‚Äù if I‚Äôm running with or pushing Dawa in the stroller, respectively. This could be good for my own training, sure, but if I can also include data for whether Dawa is running on trails or pavement and score how his little paws are doing over time ‚Ä¶ just like, being able to make a plan for him would be great, rather than guessing and playing it by ear, there‚Äôs got to be a way to visualize this and make things easier ‚Ä¶ also I get to pick a charting/visualization library to try! And learn the Strava API!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, I need to switch to sitting on the sofa so I can keep doing this, I‚Äôm at like two hours of sit and focus time today, the next task is fortunately just a lot of work rather than needing a whole lot of creative energy. I‚Äôm going to make this code so much more readable, with way less lines of code. Okay, so it‚Äôs 1161 lines right now, let‚Äôs see what we can bring it down to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, before I go, so I can wrap up quickly later, the title/description thing, I went through every paper I have, which is many papers, though now fewer, and sorted them into five categories and then garbagio. Personal and work still need sorting through, they‚Äôre shuffled a bit, but official, archival, and questionable content, stuff flagged as ‚Äòdo I need to keep this?‚Äô, all in seperate physical spaces. Having at least some notion of control over my life beyond the confines of these walls, and knowing that if I need to look for something important that I could either find it or not find it and know within a reasonable amount of time with a reasonable amount of certainty is no small comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, sofa! I revamped the sofa area so there weren‚Äôt boxes and now there‚Äôs a servicable &lt;em&gt;and charming&lt;/em&gt; nook and hopefully Dawa is okay with just chilling there for a bit until I cook his dinner, because there‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ like two dozen cases of subprocess.Popen that need processLogger applied ‚Ä¶ which is really on me to have been dense enough to repeat that many times, but I was &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; close to being able to say, ‚ÄúHere! This works! More or less! For the brave, go for it!‚Äù ‚Ä¶ sooo, now I need a post-it note with DRY taped to the monitor, but also to fix this mess. With the function‚Äôs definition and applying it once we‚Äôre at 1179 lines, from 1161, but it could maybe go down to 1080 lines?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, well I implemented it again, and fixed the function, but I had to comment about a bug and what to do about it after a few more implementations, so we‚Äôre at 1188 lines. I hope this doesn‚Äôt turn into spaghetti. Pressing on ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, indexing to get the nth item of a tuple is awesome. I love Python. 1178 lines. 1159.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Okay, so I know how to use it now, that took a bit, but that‚Äôs going to be easy-peasey in the morning. Dawa got steak tonight, some socialization with a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; cute black puppy down at the park, I‚Äôve eaten as well and am winding down! Good day! Tomorrow‚Äôs going to be great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 bike 1 day
1 bike 1 run 2 day
2 bike 1 run 3 day
3 bike 1 run 4 day
4 bike 1 run 5 day
5 bike 1 run 6 day
5 bike 2 run 7 day
6 bike 2 run 8 day
7 bike 2 run 9 day&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yay 9 day streak of running with Dawa, and only twice did I run him around the block instead of biking him to a trail for his little peets. Ahhh. My dog is happy though. &lt;span

It‚Äôs been more than a week since I‚Äôve had a day where I didn‚Äôt record a Strava activity, and I thought today I‚Äôd get a break, but Dawa was whining, and so we went back out and after I let him sniff around for a while I took him on a mile and a half run, and then we hung out at the park with another couple dogs for a bit, ‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs just started panting heavily in the corner. I‚Äôm going a little nuts here. He‚Äôs already eaten and there‚Äôs clean water in his bowl. And been brushed. We need a new squeaky toy, the current ones are too low on flavor. Active noise cancellation headphones time. though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yay, let‚Äôs make a React Native template, because I‚Äôm not using Typescript, and let me just see ‚Ä¶ yea, ReactNativeTemplate time, something simple just to get things moving here, brain-wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Sweet, I‚Äôve got a template set up for React Native the way I like to do it, more or less. Well, less, the refactor to styled-components isn‚Äôt complete because I‚Äôm still not sure how like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;flex: 2&lt;/code&gt; happens in styled-components, and I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs possible to do about bundling a styled-component back to React Native styles for the imageStyles prop, for instance, but it‚Äôs got react-navigation ready to go, though I really want to review what I saw that guy in Discord doing with his stacks and context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh wow, can‚Äôt sit, back, ow. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got like two thirds of all the papers sorted today. I decided what the categories were going to be and which went where, then took all the papers out and lined them up in piles, and decided to work from left to right. I‚Äôve got an extra table in from the patio and had the long table cleared, and had both filing cabinets the the desk emptied and the top of the desk cleared, and ‚Äòwork‚Äô was going to go on the desktop, ‚Äòofficial‚Äô in the desk on the left hand side, ‚Äòpersonal‚Äô in the desk on the right hand side, ‚Äòarchive‚Äô in the white filing cabinet, ‚Äòquestionable content‚Äô in the brown filing cabinet, as in, ‚Äúdo I need to keep this or document its existence?‚Äù, and the green filing bin for anything I‚Äôd want to bring out in case of a fire. Plenty got thrown in the trash, and I‚Äôm just about there with seperating it into categories, but a lot of it was about Mom, too, so I was like barely able to get through the day with just one breakdown, lol. Actually, it was about Dawa, too, though just the whole ‚Äòdeath‚Äô in general theme. We only did a mile this morning because my knee was hurting and I wanted to cut it short, so like all the attention he got today was, well there was the last walk, which was pretty short because it‚Äôs so hot out and nobody is outside, not too interesting, then a short one earlier in the afternoon, that mile before, and we got some grooming in before we left, and our first walkies. New brush today, too, I used the other one so much the little brushing bits were coming out. The new one feels cheap, I‚Äôm probably going to have to replace it, but if I don‚Äôt do it again as part of tomorrow‚Äôs routine ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so close to keeping him mat-free. I think the next web project I want to work on is a Dawa-tracker, because we‚Äôve gotten bike rides to different places all the past like six days in a row I think, hold on ‚Ä¶ ok, so the 13th I didn‚Äôt run him, but the 12th I took him to Bluff Point ‚Ä¶ eight days, seven runs, five locations. Yea, doing pretty good at the moment. I wonder if I could have it include the distance biked, I haven‚Äôt used the Google Maps API in a while, and I‚Äôm not even sure route-finding is part of it at all. I wish I could jump into the next activity with manic fervor here, but I‚Äôm wiped, the place is feeling heckin cozy, and I‚Äôve got a todo list that can be started early tomorrow. Ma√±ana. ~g&lt;/p&gt;

Orr-taah-gooh-gnhngl, is about as good as I can do in terms of pidgeon phonetics. He was a stitch, always walked in in a rush, either that or looking just very tired and with a look on his face like don‚Äôt talk to me, lol. We loved him because he‚Äôd swear at us, and we thought it was hilarious. Once called me ‚Äúextremely anal‚Äù over notation, which I‚Äôm somewhat proud of. Saw him years later, and poured his latte with great care, made a little flower on top with the foam, it was great :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANYWAY, I think the dog is good for a bit, we got a walk in and it‚Äôs too early to go to Harkness, though lord have mercy I don‚Äôt know if I can hook the trailer up today. We‚Äôre having success with running on grass and his little pawpads growing thicker again, though! Yesterday I was going to have a doctor‚Äôs appointment, but I lost the paperwork and was feeling super-anxious about it and asked them to send me the paperwork again and postpone the appointment, so looking at the 30th for that, but so I decided we needed to break out from the routine a little, and we biked to Oswegatchie and ran that trail, and got rained on, and it was just about at the limit of what I could do at that moment, leg-wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coding time though, I should fix the git new bug for sure, and maybe tackle the logger function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, this git new thing is driving me nuts, looking at ~/.gitconfig is next though, what‚Äôs alias new actually being stored as that it‚Äôs not coming up as a git command? AHHH Popen adds quotes automatically! Okay, no quotes!&lt;/p&gt;

Up at six, and after our first walk I brought Dawa to Harkness State Park where we get runs in and his little paws don‚Äôt have to be on concrete or asphault, and I can see improvement in the surface of his footpads! I‚Äôve been keeping his runs on the sidewalk/road extremely limited and mostly running at Harkness for weeks now, after I noticed his footpads were really worn down and smooth, and very nearly blistered, though we avoided actual blistering thank goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got a fair amount done after he was good and exercised, I took my laptop to Fort Trumbull and whipped up a few very small sample projects for HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Python, as I‚Äôm hoping to bring someone through why and how to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;master-blaster&lt;/code&gt;! V. excite!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, so then a salad happened for lunch and I ran nine miles barefoot, got groceries, took Dawa to the dog park and worked from there for a while, cooked for him, and now I‚Äôve saved/uploaded what I was working on and am enjoying this beautiful evening on my patio here, with a beverage and snacks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How long does my back permit me so sit, is really the question behind whether I get any further work done this evening, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking it‚Äôs going to be an extra-early day tomorrow, honestly I‚Äôm pretty worked for now. Pleasant evening out, though, my neighbor Ron the chef just walked by and said hello with his family, there‚Äôs a squirrel chillen out front, birds chirping, do like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes!

Almost got all the cleaning done that I wanted to yesterday, but I‚Äôve got to get some work‚Ä¶]]></description><link>https://www.garethfield.com/bike-ride!/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.garethfield.com/bike-ride!/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2020 10:03:18 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Good morning!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dawa and I got to Harkness today! Almost got all the cleaning done that I wanted to yesterday, but I‚Äôve got to get some work done here, but also, cleaning Dawa gets added to the list, I honestly don‚Äôt know how he got so dirty. Anywaay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Split my time ‚Ä¶ okay, I figure I‚Äôve got like three good hours here, so the first hour will be &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;master-blaster&lt;/code&gt;, the second RunClub, and the third my website? Let‚Äôs try it. Let‚Äôs also assume I started at 10, even though it‚Äôs 10:08, aaand here we go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I just remembered Polar Pairs ‚Ä¶ okay, 30 minute sprints, then, and I‚Äôll throw updating my resume on the end there, and Polar Pairs in between &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;master-blaster&lt;/code&gt; and RunClub, but I‚Äôm going to get a small bowl of cereal in, so we‚Äôll call it 10:15 ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;master-blaster&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, well wrapping that up took closer to 40 minutes, but yay, I was able to work on the code again and made things happen! Turns out I wasn‚Äôt actually checking users out of the branch they were on for local repos going through the remote process, so I didn‚Äôt need that, though the function I got from merfi on StackOverflow got a small modification to take in a path argument. Oh, snap, that doesn‚Äôt go to master automatically ‚Ä¶ huh ‚Ä¶ right, yea, stay in dev until later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;RunClub&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yo, I haven‚Äôt even run a React Native project on the new machine yet, this is bonkers. I bet there‚Äôs like new versions of everything and I‚Äôm not going to recognize any of the code, lol. React Native 63!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oohkay, everything is downloaded, let‚Äôs see how long Xcode takes until a basic install runs ‚Ä¶ oh, snap, I missed it, alright ‚Ä¶ okay, yeap, certificate process ‚Ä¶ ooo, packager! Computer is overheating, lol ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OOOOHHHH THAT‚ÄôS A BEAUTIFUL THING!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright buddy, walk time ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoof, okay, minorly productive day as far as dev stuff and administrative stuff goes, got the cleaning done in the afternoon, though! This place is &lt;em&gt;clean!&lt;/em&gt; Like, there are a couple of places I could point to that could use further cleaning, but getting the patio done, getting the bathroom done, and getting the kitchen clean including the dish rack done, feels good, man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not sure how Dawa is going to be here, and whether he‚Äôs going to continue to need attention and totally wear me out or if I‚Äôm going to get an evening session in, here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nnno, I feel the tiredness washing over me. Stoked that react native apps build and install maybe five to ten times quicker on the new machine, saving like five minutes at build time. That‚Äôs crazy. Whatever magic this architecture is doing, programs on the command line and everywhere else run significantly faster than on the other machines. I guess that‚Äôs what eight years of engineering will do, lol. Yay! Tomorrow let me see if I can‚Äôt get up early again, I got up earlier than I did yesterday today, but missing that magic early bird window of creativity. I feel like how many days a week I hit the flow state by 5:30 is a sign of how much I got done that week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt have it in me right now, though, I don‚Äôt even have the energy to cook. Hope y‚Äôall are well out there, back tomorrow, best wishes!

Hope you‚Äôre well today, I‚Äôve just gotten to my desk, dog is walked, got a cup of cawfee heea, missin New Yawk just a little ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so, it‚Äôs Monday, and Saturday I said, ‚ÄúHere, world!‚Äù with the program I‚Äôve been working on for three weeks, which felt like tossing it into the abyss a little, which was to be expected, but now starts phase two! Very exciting! I‚Äôm going to split my time between making improvements, other coding projects, and coding-adjacent stuff like making moves on getting a job, rather than being totally obsessed with one thing to the detriment of everything else in my life, lol!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good times, though, learned a lot. Let‚Äôs talk about it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Python!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a pleasure to work with! I wasn‚Äôt sure I was ever going to branch off into different languages, I‚Äôd just spent so much time in JavaScript land, and other languages just felt like scary distant shores, what a joy though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not like I‚Äôm leaving JavaScript, I think. I‚Äôd been thinking of picking up a project to bring this flight/drive data filetype importing/exporting library to the latest version of Blender, and that‚Äôs definitely still on the table now, especially now I have a better grasp of the language it‚Äôs written in, but I really miss the web, and apps, and, go ahead, shoot me, semi-colons. I miss semi-colons. Especially with syntax highlighting, I think they make code more sparkly, and I like putting punctuation in my sentences, and in my code. Oh, and brackets, holy-moly, this indentation thing I cannot do. I know it‚Äôs annoying when you get the number of brackets off, doubly so because it‚Äôll still run sometimes and do unexpected things, but trying to just look at it and try and count the blocks of whitespace to no no no, nope, do not want. Though, thinking back on it, I only really had trouble with massively indented code because of how I structured it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs browse the code and see what jumps out ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Imports&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual syntax is nice, which can be said for most of the small words used in Python, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;import questionary&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;from subprocess import Popen, PIPE&lt;/code&gt; is great, the dependencies thing I still don‚Äôt have my head around, because in JS it‚Äôs either from node*modules, which, fair, is magic from the build tool, or it‚Äôs &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;import AppTextInput from &amp;quot;../components&amp;quot;;&lt;/code&gt; if you‚Äôre doing like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;export * from &amp;quot;./AppTextInput.js&amp;quot;;&lt;/code&gt; from components/index.js, the ambiguity of where imports came from was just a little weird to me, but actually one of the &lt;strong&gt;reasons&lt;/strong&gt; this project was well-suited for Python was that there _weren‚Äôt* too many dependencies. The code that &lt;em&gt;edits your repos&lt;/em&gt; is right there, not super-abstracted with possible security vulnerabilities, other than me writing bugs into the code, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Iterable Slicing, Working With Iterables&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I miss JavaScript, here. Maybe my thinking is backwards on this, and am just experiencing Stockholm Syndrome, but having like slice, splice, the spread operator, and using forEach or map/filter/reduce explicity rather than ‚Ä¶ well, it‚Äôs definitely a little different than the Python way of doing things. I totally appreciate that it sort of encourages you towards abstraction, where in JavaScript after a map call you‚Äôll have like the place before the arrow or after ‚Äòfunction‚Äô for assigning whatever the arguments are going to be named, but in Python it‚Äôs &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;for noun in nouns:&lt;/code&gt; and you‚Äôre off to the races. Possibly easier to grasp, I‚Äôm not sure. I learned in the context of React, from the beggining to today with hooks and stuff ‚Ä¶ definitely helped having learned it the hard way like that, I think, or the Python syntax where the keywords are doing a lot of heavy lifting, character for character, would maybe have gone over my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, I‚Äôm excited to go further down the Python way, pretty wild, man, pretty wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm also excited to refactor this beast ‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs just say it could be much better looking, lol. Let‚Äôs talk about what I learned from a general project standpoint!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Project!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, yay, I made something! I‚Äôm pretty sure it does what it says on the tin, too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Natural Language Hard&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, then though, writing text is &lt;em&gt;hard!&lt;/em&gt; Like the text the user reads. Copy? Anyway, that took a ton of energy to context switch from coding to writing, I need to do a better job of batching that stuff and when I need to do some on the spot, just not spending too much time on it. That and naming things ‚Ä¶ like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;localBranchInfoGitBranchStdout&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;confirmRemoveLocalDirectoriesAfterPrompt&lt;/code&gt; ‚Ä¶ very descriptive, but jeez ‚Ä¶ but then I went to acronyms later on, so GitPushUpstreamOrigin just became Gpuo, but that wasn‚Äôt much of an improvement, at least not when it was repeated over several lines ‚Ä¶ refactoring the logging code into a function is one of the next things on the list, it‚Äôs going to help make it more readable, hopefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Commenting!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I started the project meaning for it to be open source, I paid way more attention to commenting my code than I ever have before, which I‚Äôm definitely going to keep doing! This probably falls under natural language being hard, too, but yea, having to describe what the code does with words is a nice little check that you‚Äôre doing what you think you‚Äôre doing. &lt;strong&gt;Tests&lt;/strong&gt; is probably the next step on this road, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Testing!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yea, I kinda just tested that each piece of code worked as I went. I can see how this might not scale. (Lol.) To the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For what it‚Äôs worth, though, Python seems to do what you think it‚Äôll do. Really nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Projects!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub Projects has been awesome to use! I hadn‚Äôt really used issue tracking before, it was a great way to organize what needed to be done and stay on task, though! I still used a fair amount of paper, maybe like 20-25 sketch sheets, it‚Äôs just a lot easier to get my brain working when I‚Äôm holding a pen sometimes, but having a kanban board right on the same page as all the code really helped keep me productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up not using the Software Requirements Specification that I made in a Notion doc as much as I thought I was going to. That might change in the future, I can see how a little extra time with the requirements might have helped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Future!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What next? Well, the program isn‚Äôt &lt;em&gt;done,&lt;/em&gt; really, though it‚Äôs gotten to a point of completeness, from a certain perspective. It &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; work. It could do more, it could be better tested, like on Windows machines, or it could be made to handle interruptions in the connection, which I think just knocks it over at the moment. It also needs to get used, and I need to get the word out, which is like a whole other thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôd also like to split my work between that and some other projects I‚Äôve got going on, like I got the artwork back from Shelly for the Polar Pairs game I was working on, and RunClub should be ready when the world is ready to socialize again, lol ‚Ä¶ and my personal website still looks like the mess of hot garbage that took me like a couple days to throw together, definitely could be a better portfolio, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there‚Äôs updating my resume, writing cover letters, filling out applications, definitely crunch time there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs also a better time than ever for teaching more people how to code! I mean, sort of, there‚Äôs a pandemic on ‚Ä¶ Crazy world we‚Äôre living in right now, keeping my spirits up though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next steps are to update the project for V1, since I kinda just put it out there without strictly sticking to it, and what‚Äôs done is done, but it‚Äôs time to set up the scaffolding V2, and also it wouldn‚Äôt be super-nice for anyone else to walk in on expecting to pick up and issue or something at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I‚Äôm going to clean my apartment. Needs it. I‚Äôve been totally obsessed for three weeks, and I do my best to keep things clean, and I think I vacuumed once, but there are dishes, very little food in the fridge, it‚Äôs dusty, the vacuuming needs doing again, the bathroom needs cleaning, the patio needs cleaning, stains need obliteration, a colony of shrews has set up shop in the outdoor storage, you get the picture. (Jk on the shrews. Good luck with the gophers, Els!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ooof, then some business needs handling that I‚Äôve definitely let slide, and yes, job, I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise is handled, however, for the moment, lol. Yesterday I didn‚Äôt type at all and just took excellent care of my dog, since I‚Äôm afraid he‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ well, I mean, definitely not neglected, he‚Äôs been getting regular runs that you can see on my Strava profile, but I‚Äôve been getting in every bit of coding that I could, taking my laptop to the dog park, only taking him on short runs sometimes, and I‚Äôve been brushing him, but he needs more, especially with this heat, he can‚Äôt be having any matting. Oh, but so yesterday I biked us over the bridge to Bluff Point in Groton and ran the trail with him there, which is eight miles total pulling him in the wagon behind the bike, plus the running, and I am &lt;em&gt;worked&lt;/em&gt; today! I was going to get up super-early, to be in the swing of things, but turned the alarm off at 4 and didn‚Äôt get up until 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to make up for it! To the future! Best wishes!

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve got to get this thing figured out! I‚Äôve got to ship. We‚Äôre shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problems right now are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the collaborator/organization stuff isn‚Äôt working, might just comment it out,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I‚Äôm having doubts as to whether having the option to only do public repos is a good design decision,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the default branch not updating, the script worked, so it‚Äôs the loop that need updating,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I‚Äôm not getting error messages back, but testing and shoring it up beyond the most basic use case has to be v2,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, my God, I‚Äôm an idiot! someProcess.stdout.read() is like a file read and once it‚Äôs read, the cursor is at the end! I was going like if len(stdout.read()) &gt; 0: and then trying to do something with stdout.read(), but I have to capture it and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; ‚Ä¶ eugh, omg lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;/// Much later. Very tired. Not getting released tonight, up early again tomorrow. Ahh. Best wishes, ~g.&lt;/p&gt;

With the clarity of a 4:30am coffee, I‚Äôve restored my repo! Whoops! Apparently &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of the subprocess commands on the machine I was testing on ran, including changing the branch, so when I went to save changes, I git push git pulled without looking at the branch name ‚Ä¶ wah wah. I needed to slow down, anyway, like maybe I can finish today, but yesterday wasn‚Äôt the day. I got the first complete (if not correct, lol) set of operations down, except for cleaning up the temp ‚Ä¶ actually I just realized the creation of the temporary branches is wrong, too, there‚Äôs a good chance there &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be a folder already at the local directory they supplied or ~/ named whatever the repo owner‚Äôs username is ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, well, lots to do, the end is in sight, let‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ test!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;/// Ahh, I haven‚Äôt been logging because I‚Äôve been just cramming in as much coding and self- and dog-care as possible, I really think tomorrow will be the day! Figured out subprocess stuff! I just don‚Äôt want to run the code before I‚Äôve read it again first thing in the morning. Good night! Best wishes! ~g&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think most of the loopy-doos are in place, just needs organizing before I can move onto the next issue, which should be pretty meaty!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Whooof! It‚Äôs a little more imperative than I‚Äôd like, but it‚Äôs getting there! I bet this thing will be seven hundred lines of code, I‚Äôm going to shoot for that. I really want to do some dishes or something ‚Ä¶ put myself together ‚Ä¶ // Okay, dishes done, self put together, Dawa got a little time at the park, got some brekkers and a coffee, back at it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Dawa has gotten two more walks. My back is killing me. Fml. Must keep coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;///&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good morning on the 7th! I haven‚Äôt been writing, so I figured I‚Äôd jump back in! Sooo close to finishing &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;master-blaster&lt;/code&gt;! It‚Äôs been non-stop, just trying to do the best I can with Dawa, and take care of myself, and code, and I kid you not this thing is so close to done! Or done enough for a v1!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I have left to do is enter in what needs to be logged to the logfile, give the user more feedback as that‚Äôs happening, and when the repos and branch requests are going on, and at the end, though the whole process there can be improved tremendously, but then I‚Äôm going to write in some warnings and document how to use the thing and exactly what it does, look further into freezing it and other packaging things, review the copy one more time, and push! GO!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and handle the patch response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Well, on saving changes after test flight 4, I‚Äôve messed up my git repo for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;master-blaster&lt;/code&gt; and need to go through things meticulously. Fuuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has turned into a tomorrow problem! Best wishes!

I‚Äôm going to be able to see today! Very exciting! And Dawa is rolled over on the floor still panting after a bike ride to Harkness and back with a 2 mile run in there (hot, even at 8am, have to shoot for earlier!) and I‚Äôve got another coffee and the package with &lt;strong&gt;my glasses!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For like two weeks, I haven‚Äôt been able to see, and no blue light protection, so I‚Äôm waking up with my eyes red like I‚Äôm stoned or something, also, &lt;em&gt;ouch,&lt;/em&gt; and I really don‚Äôt need more pain right now. Managing back pain has like, partially taken over my life right now, lol. But new glasses! Not going to trust the outside pocket for anything that could potentially bounce out again, lol, went downtown and they were gone, even went back over the route twice ‚Ä¶ eff! They were such nice glasses, too. The &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; pair I had, and that was a great story, good times, anyway, they made me feel like ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm having a hard time describing it ‚Ä¶ like I‚Äôd embraced my feminine side, to a degree, but these made me feel like I could be who I was and feel not just appropriately androgenous or whatever, but really &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; looking ‚Ä¶ I know it‚Äôs crazyily vain, but with that little modification to my face I was able to bring waaay closer to one hundred percent at work and in public. That was right when people at work not only had been appreciating how hard I worked to make things nice and to look out for them and everyone in that place on both sides of the line, but they heard my story and told me that I was accepted, that I belonged there. That brought a lot of closure on the previous ‚Ä¶ when was that? Obama was president. I don‚Äôt ‚Ä¶ know ‚Ä¶ oh, so Google Photos says in late 2015 I was at Merrell, so this must have been like October 2016. So, eleven years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big shoes, new glasses, big shoes. I got them &lt;em&gt;online&lt;/em&gt; too ‚Ä¶ so much cheaper! Let‚Äôs see, let‚Äôs see!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haha, well, let me try again with the look thing when I‚Äôve cut my hair and lost a few pounds, but I can &lt;strong&gt;see!&lt;/strong&gt; Nice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can‚Äôt code though, Dawa wants to go out again. Had a feeling we might need one more walk here, he hadn‚Äôt pooped on our first walk. C‚Äôest la vie avec chien.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Okay, pooped! Coding mode GO!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yay! Took all the todos for a V1 of this program and added them to a ‚ÄúV1‚Äù GitHub project! That took a while, though, you‚Äôve got to add the issue, then go to new cards in the project, then go back to the issue, and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; there‚Äôs the option to pick a column for it. Or you can add card and then convert to issue, but that irks me, I want to be able to raise issues where I‚Äôve always raised issues, it‚Äôs labeled ‚ÄòIssues‚Äô, it‚Äôs where if you‚Äôve got issues, gate‚Äôs open, come on in. Got issues? Don‚Äôt we all! &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Twitchkidd/gfcom/issues&quot;&gt;https://github.com/Twitchkidd/gfcom/issues&lt;/a&gt;, bring ‚Äòem on. Nice kanban board on GitHub projects though, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Twitchkidd/master-blaster/projects/v1&quot;&gt;https://github.com/Twitchkidd/master-blaster/projects/v1&lt;/a&gt;. I started using that template on the Polar Pairs project, and I think it really helped make sure I got to everything and worked on one thing at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up, issue #7 I classified as a bug that there was no log file. Yea. About to be messing with a bunch of repos at once, I want a record of what I‚Äôve done, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Oh, again I‚Äôm finding the stuff baked right into Python is just sooo nice. Standing desk time, 11:30! And I‚Äôve got a soup that‚Äôll cure what ails you, holy moley!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yay, card for #7 needs to be revisited, the logging is happening though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;4, custom loopy-doos! Most of the questions are in a flat list, I‚Äôve got the more custom thing going on for some inputs, but not all, HENCE!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My back is &lt;em&gt;killing&lt;/em&gt; me right now, lol standing here and coding is a no-go right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Okay, so, it‚Äôs much later, ready to go though, went for a long walk, set up a lot of pillows on the sofa, walked Dawa again, he got dinner, snacks, chewies, he‚Äôs okay, let‚Äôs go!&lt;/p&gt;

So close to getting &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;master-blaster&lt;/code&gt; done (enough for me to use it myself) and then I‚Äôm going to call out to social media for anyone who wants to help guide improving it, and work on the things I‚Äôve totally been neglecting. Ahhh. You can say it‚Äôs a very, very small program and sure, that, ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt ask for the branch to be changed from master to main, we wanted police to stop killing us. How‚Äôs that going?‚Äù ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not GitHub, though. If I was GitHub, it would‚Äôa &lt;em&gt;been&lt;/em&gt; changed, and the default page too, and I‚Äôd already have stopped working with ICE ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not Microsoft though, I‚Äôm just some guy, and I think words do have a certain power. I could have been looking for a job though, I hope some talented Black devs got some spots while this was ‚Ä¶ lol, while this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; going down, still going ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up, though! Must post this program up! I‚Äôve only got to finish the set of if statements about which repos to do what to and which to raise exceptions for, write the set of commands to change things, do the git alias thing, have it log what it does at least so some poor soul out there who doesn‚Äôt read the documentation can at least see what they‚Äôve done, write the documentation, and change how it‚Äôs run, which I think will be easy-peasy ‚Ä¶ let me try that now ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// a) not easy-peasy, context switchy-witchy. Finish the code. b) Dropped my phone in a marsh and had to bike my dog back and go back out for it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, back at it! /// (And apparently just knocked out at some point!) Best wishes! ~g&lt;/p&gt;

Sorry no blog posts for a while, I‚Äôve been rockin‚Äô and rollin‚Äô though! &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;master-blaster&lt;/code&gt; is almost ready for a release! I think I need one or two more early sessions with full attention and a prolonged attension span, which has been &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; hard to nail down lately. After the move, my back went all crazy, and I‚Äôve been staying active so that &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; don‚Äôt go all crazy, rough balance though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically though, I need to get this thing to a point where &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; can use it, and at least create a log file for wtf it‚Äôs doing if someone else decides to use it and needs to know, and then I need to share it and try to get someone(s) who know what they‚Äôre doing to help make it more broadly applicable, update my resume, and then split my time again between cover letter writing and applications and whatever the next project is :) It might be Polar Pairs again, because Shelly is coming through with some artwork!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm going to assume no more updates for the day though, my sleep schedule is all out of whack, I got up crazy early today and started working, but it‚Äôs already whatever o‚Äôclock and I‚Äôm losing it. Lot I‚Äôm working on right now, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes!

&lt;p&gt;Also, I need to document my code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And experience of the editor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I typed cmd+f for find, typed in ‚Äòrepositories‚Äô,
and it pulled up all the matches in the file,
but then I typed cmd+sft+f because I thought
that might be how to find all exact matches,
it pulled up all the matches in the &lt;em&gt;project!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you ‚Ä¶ are you kidding mm ‚Ä¶ aaahh! &lt;em&gt;THAT&lt;/em&gt;
is where that shortcut lives? I maybe just thought
somehow if it was my own code I would know which
files to go to or some crap?! No! CMD+SFT+F and SEARCH PROJECT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn‚Äôt actually need that right then, though, lol, to be clear.
Just one file at the moment, and it‚Äôs maage=&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I think I‚Äôve got the flow of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;master-blaster&lt;/code&gt; back, I‚Äôm going to just rely on devs being able to generate a token and bring it back to the terminal ‚Ä¶ hopefully they can do it, hopefully this is still faster than going through 60 repos one by one, hopefully this lowers the barrier to changing branches from master to main or whatever, let‚Äôs go! Then when I run out of energy later I‚Äôve got some hardware stuff to do! Yay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New machine is great, btw, though I‚Äôm having a hard time using the right-click function on the trackpad, and it‚Äôs running a little hot. No WONDER, though, how did they get a whole computer in here?! It‚Äôs TINY!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok go go go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;//&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahhhh, I‚Äôm not used to python environment stuff yet! I ran pipenv install -e . and pipenv shell, and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; I was able to run master-blaster ‚Ä¶ eep though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;//&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I picked the GNU license, which disallows creating closed versions of the program. Not that it would stop racists, they don‚Äôt have any damn decency to begin with, but it‚Äôs something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up is testing the testpypi distribution, making a build alias, making it &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; something, lol, then to pypi! Let‚Äôs lock that name in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ummm and long_description, all that jazz :) (Oh, that‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the whole readme ‚Ä¶ got it ‚Ä¶ moving these comments over here, lol ‚Ä¶)&lt;/p&gt;

For a second, though, imagine you find out that people didn‚Äôt tell you that your enslavement was supposed to be over &lt;strong&gt;TWO YEARS AGO.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like, what the fuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing I was going to do was fix the sound in this game I‚Äôm working on, but I forgot I haven‚Äôt changed over my git branch names yet. Today‚Äôs the perfect day for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, boy, okay ‚Ä¶ so this is not a reason to not do it, obviously, but I‚Äôm going to have to clone every repo on my github and change each branch. I want to write a script for this ‚Ä¶ first fixing what branch a git repo inits with, thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hanselman.com/blog/EasilyRenameYourGitDefaultBranchFromMasterToMain.aspx&quot;&gt;Scott Hanselman&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git config --global alias.new &amp;#39;!git init &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/main&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt; and the rest of the article!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oof, this machine is so slow. I don‚Äôt really want to open it up and switch the ram out though, like I don‚Äôt think I would mess it up, but if I did I wouldn‚Äôt have a computer for a few days, and I don‚Äôt want that, lol. There was a tweet recently about the American dream being to use a computer to make enough money to never use a computer again ‚Ä¶ I dunno, man, I really like using a computer. At least when things are going well, lol. I don‚Äôt have to look to type, I don‚Äôt need my fingers to leave the keys to do things, I don‚Äôt get bored ‚Ä¶ meh, anyway ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New shell function for new git folders! I need to figure out how to stop prettier from stripping whitespace from my mardown files to paste it in, though, which I should have done a while ago, lol, but I‚Äôve had two cups of coffee and need to go for a bike ride :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Beuno, coffee beans and an HDMI cable acquired, monkey brain quieted, standing desk configured, dog ‚Ä¶ dog got a short walk in, he‚Äôs going to have to wait until later for a longer one. He keeps on trying to go over to where we used to live, which is really not kosher dill ‚Ä¶ he‚Äôll get there. I‚Äôve got to do this thing, though. Wish I had a backyard, mais c‚Äôest la vie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;///&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoohhhkay! So! A) Had an adventure with Dawa, he‚Äôs definitely taken care of, exercised, socialized, and ate well, and B) I‚Äôve got all of my repos cloned, which was kinda step one there because the process is to clone the repo, rename master to main, push, then change the default branch on github, then delete the remote branch, and I spent some time getting my python environment better set up because I want to write a script so I don‚Äôt have to use github.com 56 times (lol, too many repos, but down from 68! Unintended good side effect!) which might actually be faster at this point, but if I make a script for it to just change all of your repos to main, BEUNO! Then I can share it and help making the world a more inclusive place easy! (Which is what developers like, we‚Äôre lazy, except when we‚Äôre the opposite of lazy :) That‚Äôs a tomorrow thing, though, I almost succumbed to heat exhaustion again today, for the second time in a week! Time for me to chiiiillll!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes!

&lt;p&gt;So I ended up having to move to another apartment, and my other machine isn‚Äôt working, so I‚Äôve &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; got myself back into a working flow here. Got my dot files squared away, not going to have to do &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; again for a bit, got some artwork commissioned for a game I‚Äôm working on for my niece, got someone I‚Äôm going to be teaching to code ‚Ä¶ yea! Hoping the second part of 2020 is less traumatic than the first half. Who knows though, it still really sucks out there in the world. Gotta do this thing though, so let‚Äôs go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;/// Yea, okay! Coded! Code happened! Also a lot of back pain happened! Finally got a doctor‚Äôs appointment for in a month though! First time in more than a decade! We‚Äôll pick this up tomorrow, I‚Äôm going to do some meal prep and re-pot my orchids! Woo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lol, so I find myself &lt;em&gt;playing&lt;/em&gt; the game instead of developing it, so that‚Äôs a good sign, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, no, though, lol ‚Ä¶ as I go to deploy v0.0.1, I‚Äôm looking into the code for this very site, and what a train wreck. Ah, there it is though, in Layout, under /components. Oof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lol, sort of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentally and emotionally I‚Äôm not really caught up; with everything going on, I‚Äôve had three breakdowns already today and it‚Äôs not even noon ‚Ä¶ and they weren‚Äôt even over coding (eugh, jk.) Almost over coding, though, I‚Äôve been in Express/Pug land for long enough I‚Äôve forgotten how to do simple things in JS/React ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Uhh, so, got somewhat further with that, listened to some tech podcasts, and due to unforseen circumstances, I‚Äôm going to call it an evening and make an effort to establish the early rise that I so prided myself on not so long ago. What a time to be alive.&lt;/p&gt;

For context, we‚Äôre a week into protests over George Flyod‚Äôs murder. I was to upset to be able to work at all yesterday, and today I wasn‚Äôt sure I was going to get there, but I took Dawa for a bike ride somewhere new, hopefully he‚Äôs happy, we‚Äôve both got some exercise whether my Achilles liked it or not, and ‚Ä¶ well, I really am not supre-inspired to work on serious things right now. To quote Marshall Bock on Design Details this week,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, yea, no, I don‚Äôt give a shit about pixels right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I might be able to keep myself working if I change gears a little and do something for someone else, so I‚Äôm going to make a game for my niece. She‚Äôs five, and I read that memory games were good for that age, since pre-literate kids rely more heavily on memory, so we‚Äôre going to make a Match Up/Pairs game with Penny the Purple Penguin, and I‚Äôm going to forbid myself from going on social media for the rest of the day, because I‚Äôd really like to sleep tonight. I feel bad for not doing more, but I can‚Äôt donate anything right now, I‚Äôm not going to leave my dog here and go protest in New London, and like, yea, I know, if I‚Äôm anxious and scared and mad all at the same time, imagine how Black people in this country feel right now. Resistance isn‚Äôt a one-lane highway though, we need people protesting, donating, using their voice, and we need some people to hang in and not give up hope. If that‚Äôs your lane, hang in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, making a game ‚Ä¶ I wrote out some ideas on a big piece of paper and I‚Äôve got tofubeats - POSITIVE going in the background, so let‚Äôs do this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohhh, finding images for all these animals isn‚Äôt going to be a thing, lol. Okay, I‚Äôm going to make it with just placeholders, and then when the rest of it is in place, I‚Äôll be more likely to do the illustration, as seeing the end result get better immediately will motivate me. Illustration can be fun, but I‚Äôm not necessarily super comfy with it, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wtf, now VSCode isn‚Äôt opening folders? Aaand quit and reopen worked. Wtf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, also, so this had a place to live, the React core team made a statement against Facebook‚Äôs actions! Vjeux turned out to be a racist though! Crazy! Not using Recoil, lol. Wtf. I almost don‚Äôt want to use React, definitely going to be trying other things out, but I need a quick coding win so I can get back to it here. /// To the future!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes!

&lt;p&gt;Yay! It‚Äôs several hours later, which ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs good that I took the time, the next time I look at a set of nginx config files I‚Äôll be much more familiar, but I‚Äôm glad that I don‚Äôt have to do any more of that right now because the website is UP! ü•≥ Not that it says much right now, just the create-react-app template, and also I‚Äôm not sure when trailcity.net is going to go to the ip address, but the ip address works! Woot! Back to the land of familiarity with me! I‚Äôm about to be so productive!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really I need to have Figma open and get the design -&gt; develop -&gt; deploy thing going. //&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LOL! I was looking for work flows for solo designer/developers and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@jmgant.cleareyeconsulting/scrum-and-the-solo-dev-fb8e810ed42b#d5e7&quot;&gt;Michael Gant cracked me up with this:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And what the fuck! Trying to think about programming or design right now, like wtf ‚Ä¶ okay, I need my head in the game, though, or what good am I?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebuilt my Linode because I couldn‚Äôt ssh in. Starting again with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linode.com/docs/development/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs-and-nginx-on-debian-10/&quot;&gt;how-to-install-nodejs-and-nginx-on-debian-10&lt;/a&gt; ‚Ä¶ domain name, dns records ‚Ä¶ oop, rebuilding the Linode didn‚Äôt fix my ssh problem. ####.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, nuked it, we‚Äôll try again ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going to punt, too, and try their one-click install of the MERN stack. Like ‚Ä¶ if it works, why not? Whole idea behind having an actual box anyway is if I need to I can get in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, sweet, not locked out of my own box anymore. That was so frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not convinced my hosts file is right. Blah. Added 127.0.1.1 lkjhalsdkjfhalsdkjfhlaksdjhfasdlkjfh ‚Ä¶ okay automatic security updates ‚Ä¶ limited user ‚Ä¶ second computer ssh ‚Ä¶ oh, whoops, I never actually got the dotfiles thing quite done ‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre backed up, but the automatic process doesn‚Äôt work ‚Ä¶ okay, WELL! One server. Oh ‚Ä¶ except the ssh allowed only has one public key, that‚Äôs what scp does, lol. Okaaay ‚Ä¶ bash profile ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, man, going all day on this trying to get the nginx config set up. Didn‚Äôt I have a resource that I listed here somewhere? Huh, nope, just what the Linode support people sent me. Weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this isn‚Äôt going to be as difficult as defeating systemic racism, surely, and I‚Äôm barely keeping it together here, so I‚Äôm signing off for today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the fuck,

Or midday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ouch! Finally cut myself with my Chemex that‚Äôs been a jagged nightmare on top since I broke it washing it last year. Eugh, such an uncomfortable feeling, that scrape where no scrape should be. Hwoof!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alight, let‚Äôs see, I think it‚Äôs time I switched over to a React frontend, honestly I just can‚Äôt see myself opening those Pug files again except as a reference for a moment. The nice folks at on the Linode support team shot me a link to React with Express, though there are some super-interesting things going on right now with ‚Ä¶ how do we say ‚Ä¶ if React is a &lt;em&gt;library&lt;/em&gt; for UI management, there are several &lt;em&gt;frameworks&lt;/em&gt; that are making a big splash right now. I mean, from hearing Scott Tolynski talk about Svelte, I definitely want to check that out, too, but I just really crave some familiarity and getting some stuff done. I want to feel like I own my codebase again. I want to feel like I‚Äôm in control of my life a little again, lol. What a time ‚Ä¶ dear reader if you‚Äôre joining us from the future, there are more protests all across the country right now, in the middle of a pandemic, in the middle of a recession, and freedom and democracy are under attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let‚Äôs push some pixels for a second, with the intent of pushing them for the forces of good, lol! (Oh, let me push yesterday‚Äôs post, lol, that too ‚Ä¶)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eugh, so I couldn‚Äôt ssh into the box after not having touched it for a month, who knows, I didn‚Äôt do anything crazy on it, so I‚Äôm just going to rebuild it and go through setting it up again. It‚Äôs like ‚Ä¶ fullstack is weird like this, either I‚Äôm thinking about colors, icons, typography, and nudging pixels around, or I‚Äôm thinking about data flow through on the client-side and all that frontend engineering stuff, or I‚Äôm thinking about nginx and ports and iptables and &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; not knowing what I‚Äôm doing, though better than a few years ago, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had to search through my papers to find the password ‚Ä¶ definitely still getting organized here. I‚Äôve definitely made more progress in the past week on that. When my brain stops working this afternoon that might be the filler task. Ooo, speaking of, though, the laundry is probably ready! A check cleared today and I could finially do my laundry again. Never a dull, as my mother would say :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lol, I wonder if I can work on design, frontend dev, and backend dev at the same time if I go like 10 minutes with one, then the other, then the other ‚Ä¶ Okay, that‚Äôs the plan, and I‚Äôm going to figure something out so I can document ‚Ä¶ the ‚Ä¶ lol &lt;strong&gt;IF ONLY&lt;/strong&gt; there was a place I had to write out my process for future reference! (website points at self)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs nice to have a dedicated docs for each part though ‚Ä¶ tomorrow early!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes!

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve got to make some changes in my life, and I‚Äôve got to see a doctor, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So overwhelmed right now ‚Ä¶ yea, doesn‚Äôt seem like any coding is going to get done today. I‚Äôm a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However! I &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; mentioned in episode 348: Getting Unstuck of the Design Details podcast (!) and was &lt;strong&gt;wildly&lt;/strong&gt; misquoted in New London‚Äôs newspaper The Day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like running or biking; this is my thing, I like juggling,‚Äù he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alrighty, so it‚Äôs evening, I‚Äôve relaxed somewhat, still going to be a stressfull week, mais c‚Äôest la vie, let‚Äôs check &lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt; out though! &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gatsby-remark-vscode&lt;/code&gt; is a plugin that ‚Ä¶ well, &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; soak up my vscode theme so that code looks like ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

I‚Äôm listening to ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll Never Walk Alone‚Äù after listening to The Anthropocene Reviewed earlier, and ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alrighty, let‚Äôs do it to it. // Yay all my files are finally backed up, lol. Next up is to take the hard drive out and secure the cable under it, which hopefully doesn‚Äôt break it, but I have another machine, just in case, lol. Then will be ‚ÄúWhat do I do with the Run Club project?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I feel like, instead of starting by making decisions about either trying to get the current code how I‚Äôd like it, take a trip back to design-land, or upgrade to React and go from there, the right way to get myself to actually do this thing rather than faffing about for eternity is to put on the business hat and walk through what actually treating it like a product I‚Äôm going to release. When I‚Äôve got deadlines (balanced with applications and all the other job-getting activity,) then I‚Äôll put the coding hat on again. For the moment, let‚Äôs see if I break my laptop, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Yay? So I popped it open, and there was like ‚Ä¶ I want to say it looked like mold ‚Ä¶ in places. A) Wtf. Why is there mold everywhere here. Bleach ftw. and B) I doused the bottom cover in bleach spray ‚Ä¶ but then a flap came off, and there was a silvery powder in thethere, and I really don‚Äôt know what it is or how much damage I‚Äôve potentially done. I assume it‚Äôs something to do with electricity because it goes right over the battery ‚Ä¶ Anyway, so I‚Äôm going to be watching it carefully for a while so it doesn‚Äôt like ‚Ä¶ combust ‚Ä¶ Hmm. Either that or the glitter flakes are going to short something in there ‚Ä¶ or it‚Äôs really bad for me and shouldn‚Äôt have gotten it on my skin ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live amongst uncertainty, though. We do what we can do, we use our best judgement, and at the end of the day there‚Äôs always a certain kind of peace one can take away from Ecclesiates, chapter 9, verse 11:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again I saw that under the sun the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor riches to the intelligent, nor favor to the skillfull; but time and chance happen to them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Hohhkay, so: no sleep last night, have kept it together pretty well here, up and at ‚Äòem at 5:15, pushing to do what I can do today ‚Ä¶ pretty soon I have to reconfigure this thing‚Äôs gatsby-node file and some other jazz so I can have some posts be part of the running tab, etc., because I was about to go on about my training plan for the next three weeks, but this is the coding section of the blog? That might be a tomorrow thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learned about CSP, nonces, and hashes to defend against XSS attacks. Nice! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/locking-down-your-website-scripts-with-csp-hashes-nonces-and-report-uri/&quot;&gt;Thanks Troy Hunt!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, boy, just did the business thing. June 22nd! Three weeks and a weekend to launch an app with three and a half years of ideation. About right, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I‚Äôm going to table that for tomorrow morning when hopefully I‚Äôve had some sleep, but I can feel it even now, when you set goals like that, they start to pull on you from the inside. Let‚Äôs see how well I can balance this. Goodnight! And,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes!

The morning was spent on the script that automates making new posts, because believe it or not a few dozen times later I‚Äôm really tired of oping the editor, right clicking on blog and creating a folder, naming it, creating index.md in it, opening another blog post, copy-pasting the frontmatter over, changing the title, changing the date, changing the description ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough. No more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gg&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;np&lt;/code&gt; and I get prompted for a title and description, the answers are validated, there‚Äôs a prompt for confirmation, and then the folder gets made, the file gets made, the frontmatter gets populated, and the project and file are opened in the editor. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Twitchkidd/gfcom/blob/master/utils/new-post/index.js&quot;&gt;Code.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the backup is just about done, too, where are we? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to try to really keep the other laptop at parity, I think I can trust ‚Ä¶ hmm ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ I almost typed something that would have had my knuckles going for a knocking on the nearest wooden object ‚Ä¶ well for the &lt;em&gt;moment,&lt;/em&gt; I‚Äôm going to trust Microsoft and Google with my data. Eep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, trained hard the past few days, dog is happy, I think ‚Ä¶ hanging in, here. Might add a post-script, in any case however,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes!

&lt;p&gt;Oooh, I left myself a mess though. Good flipping morning from past-self, lol. This is like those memes where the caption would be ‚ÄúWho wrote this garbage?‚Äù and Rick pulls back the wall, but it‚Äôs a mirror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;/// Much later:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oof! I love doing stuff that‚Äôs very language-level, after last night I could definitely only bust out four or four and a half hours of solid work there, and I umm ‚Ä¶ yea, it‚Äôs not done yet. Needs to be a tomorrow morning thing though, I can‚Äôt sit any more today, lol. Steady on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And best wishes!

Alrighty, must focus. I‚Äôm actually just getting around to writing after a few rounds, I‚Äôve got a little tech demo set up, I‚Äôve had a run and two coffees, Dawa will probably need a walk soon here, so let me see if I can blast through this, I really want to try this react-wordcloud library out, and feed it my blog posts here, lol. Could be good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve got like eighty things open right now, not really eighty, but it feels like it, because like I‚Äôll go down a rabbit hole and I‚Äôll do as good a job being thorough on the way back ‚Ä¶ okay, no dig! Lol! Finish the ten little projects you set yourself up for, go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;/// Whoa ‚Ä¶ okay, so, I can‚Äôt look at code anymore. I so don‚Äôt really &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to do this word-cloud thing, but I should really get more familiar with this kind of map-reduce thing. Right now, the next step when my head is on straight again is to make sure I have it very clear where the asynchronous calls are being made. Got a functioning reducer for one file, just need to map over the files now. Got the files, too. Woot. Good night!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And best wishes!

It‚Äôs been exciting already! Including bathtime for Dawa! Keeping everything clean and myself sane has definitely been a challenge, I think I‚Äôm doing pretty well though! Dawa got his bath, it wasn‚Äôt too too strenuous for him, we got a short run in, same, I got my spinach and vitamins in with my first coffee, got a little gluten-free granola with fruit and nuts and soy milk, about to make another coffee, Dawa‚Äôs chomping on a bully stick, I‚Äôm like put together by a reasonable hour this morning, got a little bit of a workout in ‚Ä¶ yea!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to get this thing backed up, and I need to get Run Club finished and launched, lol. I keep on wanting to do other things, which I should totally do, but like I was thinking through various projects, a voice in my head said, ‚Äù‚Ä¶ but is your box backed up?‚Äù to which my other voice responded, ‚Äú‚Ä¶ Right.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Okay, walked Dawa &lt;em&gt;one more time&lt;/em&gt; this morning, it‚Äôs like an hour later. Whwoo-boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I was still backing up my dotfiles. Super nice out, working outside! Got some crudites going ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoa, todo!! I don‚Äôt have automatic https upgrades on my website! Whaaat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Lol, so my laptop was going slow, and I‚Äôve got two browsers and Spotify open, but still, and then I realized I‚Äôd plugged it in and had turned Folding@Home on full power ‚Ä¶ ahh! Got it! Full is 4 cores, medium is 3, light is 1, sweet. Just discovered visualization options, too! Fan‚Äôs on ‚Ä¶ hmmm ‚Ä¶ going light mode, have a tile under the front of the computer, screen all the way down etc, see if it stops ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I‚Äôm going to try Firefox for a bit. I like Brave, but I‚Äôm always running into things not working, and I wonder if Firefox and me are ready for eachother, lol. // ‚Ä¶ after a bit, I‚Äôm not sure. I feel like more of my data is going to facebook, I keep seeing it pop up ‚Ä¶ maybe it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, to the future! Best wishes!

&lt;p&gt;Wow, so I hadn‚Äôt gotten to learning about &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;scp&lt;/code&gt; in the other post even ‚Ä¶ big couple of days, backing up the other computer, getting my repos organized, and I got my office supplies divvied up properly between my work desk, traditional desk, and writing desk, finally, almost six months later, lol. Woke up at 4 to get done what I‚Äôve gotten done the past few days. Today was a quarter to 6 though, when Dawa alerted me to his need to go outside, and I hadn‚Äôt heard that desperation in his tone for too long I guess and he poo‚Äôd the rug, and somehow I didn‚Äôt even realize leaving the place, I just threw some shoes on and harnessed him up, and came back to it being cleaning time. Poor little guy threw up later in the day, too. üò¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, well, coming to you from an apartment that‚Äôs like seriously clean right now and thinks to a certain set of windfalls, there‚Äôs &lt;strong&gt;food&lt;/strong&gt; in the fridge! Stoked, for right now though, I‚Äôve got to continue backing up the other machine. Next I have to set up the symlinks for my dotfiles, add in the terminal theme and put it in git, and ‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs see, so I‚Äôve got a repo in ~/Code that‚Äôs tracking et ceteral code things, but dots has its own repo, as do courses, demos, projects, teaching, tech-tests, and templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oof, stoked to possibly have a decent chair in the budget, I sit for like five minutes as of late and my back is totally killing me. I think I actually need to pivot to cooking mode and walking Dawa again here soon, but I‚Äôm pretty stoked for the next time I can sit, just like, not at the end of the day when I‚Äôm &lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; able to support my spine properly, no beuno. Stoked for tomorrow morning, basically, and I have some new motivations in my life! Tell you about them over a bev, my Internet friend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes!

Up early today, 4, goin‚Äô ham today!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in episode six hundred and seventy five of Gareth is a silly goose, I thought Time Machine &lt;em&gt;compressed&lt;/em&gt; the data it was backing up, but it takes more, so of course I can‚Äôt use the smaller drives to back up the bigger one, and actually the middle size drive seems to be crashing both machines when I plug it in, so I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with that, but I‚Äôm going to get my second machine up to parity, put everything under source control, then I‚Äôm going to shore up the main machine so the hard drive cable doesn‚Äôt break, hopefully, and then I can be done with the backing up project for the moment, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Btw check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://foldingathome.org/&quot;&gt;Folding@home!&lt;/a&gt; You can help fight Coronavirus and it gives you a sweet visualizer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, for the record, if Android development is help up again with debugging from device, I think Chrome instance 2 auto-updated from v45?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yay the machine is working, though, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;//
&lt;span id=&quot;podcast&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
What a rollercoaster of a day! I‚Äôm probably not going to talk about part 2 at the moment, but wow! (Good things mostly.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to tech though, most of the software is onto the other computer at least, and I was about to start some &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git clone&lt;/code&gt; action goin‚Äô on, when like, day part 2 happened, but so that also included a walk with Dawa where I listened to &lt;a href=&quot;https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/jsj-431-personal-branding-for-developers-with-morad-stern/&quot;&gt;the JavaScript Jabber podcast episode 431 with Morad Stern, Personal Branding for Developers&lt;/a&gt; and took notes, and so here‚Äôs them again so I learn them better ‚Ä¶ thanks brain! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal Brand: just think, ‚Äúwhat you think of when you think of [persons_name].‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platform #1 Where devs talk: Twitter. (Go Reactiflux though!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan Abramov might have 240,000 Twitter followers, but he wasn‚Äôt born with that, and would you hire Dan Abramov? (( Absolutely. ))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs never too late, the various digital assets, LinkedIn, etc., should be done in the good times, not in an emergency. (Put in time here, may be behind)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The How: Tooling!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scheduling! 1hr/wk min&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mapping: territory: frontend/fullstack : terms associated : thought leaders: dates of events and releases in the industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accurate mapping : highest value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It comes from your experience, what you know, and that‚Äôs the link to:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blog posts, podcasts, youtube, and you can post on twitter/linkedin ‚Ä¶ how to share ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Busting myths! ‚ÄúEverybody knows what I know.‚Äù No!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúBlog Your Journey‚Äù :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soft skills practice!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential employers look at GitHub stars and views etc.!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being part of the community, ! FAME ++ COMRADERIE! MAKE AND IMPACT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always be bringing value!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs like having marketing before a sale (product vs. hire ‚úÖ)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platforms - Online / Offline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminder: Dev lyfe ‚Äòbout learnin‚Äô
Content ‚Äòbout learnin‚Äô,
practice! Make and make it look good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offline : Meetups : Talks! (Now online, lol!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what I know!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tweets* happen from these! *etc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scheduling // ‚ÄúWhatever you do, in the beginning, you‚Äôre not going to break the Internet.‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mapping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hit the gas! // Practice consuming good content too!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ aaand that‚Äôs where that and this post end for the moment, should come back to this and turn it into paragraphs and a blog post though (and put it on LinkedIn, lol.) Ciao, and:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes!

&lt;p&gt;So I‚Äôm trying to wrangle my hard drives here, and I think we‚Äôve got a 500, 250, and 160 here ‚Ä¶ the 160 on the other machine is giving me trouble, and I just found an archive from like ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even know, actually, let‚Äôs see ‚Ä¶ 2016 ‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm trying resetting the PRAM etc to get it to see the bootable USB again, that was the problem last time, right? I just would rather have ‚Ä¶ well rather see the thing working again and then we can talk about backups. Dang‚Äôd booting these things up and seeing the blinking file icon with a question mark inside. Yay it‚Äôs going!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, and so while I wait on that and let what to do about this backup from 2016, I might have all of it in Google Drive already, am I going to search file by file? Why is it there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Anyway, _while that marinates,_ I **met** someone today! I am super in work mode right now, but I&apos;m **very** excited and hope to become very good friends with them! Deep breaths, though, and why didn&apos;t booting from the USB work, lol üòÉ --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why didn‚Äôt booting from the USB work, lol üòÉ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, okay, the folder 250dump, that‚Äôs what that means ‚Ä¶ so if that‚Äôs backed up already ‚Ä¶ oh, and the USB did work, I just needed to run install, classic. Gooooood morning! Another cup of coffee is possibly called for. I‚Äôve got to slim this drive down though, node_modules, media, all that ‚Ä¶ //&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mmm, coffee. Handled some financial stuff, that‚Äôs off my mind now ‚Ä¶ oh, wow, good amount of stuff to delete ‚Ä¶ fastest &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;node_modules/&lt;/code&gt; hunter in the East, lol ‚Ä¶ so I had 180gb used? How low can we go? Ohhh, it‚Äôs still going, lol ‚Ä¶ took a shower, still going ‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre at 731,514 deleted ‚Ä¶ okay, sweet ‚Ä¶ media on its way to being cleaned up ‚Ä¶ 159gb already though, that‚Äôs nice ‚Ä¶ nooo, being logged into the wrong wifi finally bit me! That‚Äôs okay, just some time ‚Ä¶ oh, yay, go Google Drive uploader go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ú® 155gb! ‚ú®&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, sooo much of that was node_modules folders. Crazy. Now let‚Äôs try the backup thing ‚Ä¶ 21 minutes, cool ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll clean up some Run Club stuff ‚Ä¶ uhoh, are you frozen, Time Machine? I‚Äôll give it to the top of the hour, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Ahh, so frustrating! I‚Äôm about to say forget about Time Machine, and I‚Äôm just going to back everything I need to back up on cloud services and be done with it! One more try though, it says 104 seconds ‚Ä¶ the smell of my green tea fills my nostrils, the hair on my legs stands up, I straighten my back up ever so slightly ‚Ä¶ 38 seconds ‚Ä¶ luscious music plays in the background ‚Ä¶ 14 seconds ‚Ä¶ the tension is in the shoulders ‚Ä¶ wrists, neck, preparing backup ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ what if saving this file while it said preparing backup broke it? What if ‚Ä¶ I deleted some stuff I wrote here, it‚Äôs hard to get tone right in print, but I was going for a descent into madness type deal. Okay I‚Äôll give it to 3:30, then I‚Äôm shutting it ‚Ä¶ JOY! What a rollercoaster day, lol, and now sadly I‚Äôm falling asleep at my desk and am going to bust a mission here ‚Ä¶ ehh, maybe in a minute, I want to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ooo, now I know the gist behind git-flow, yay, I‚Äôm going to use source control differently now! I‚Äôve got the cheatsheet from &lt;a href=&quot;https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/&quot;&gt;nvie.com/&lt;/a&gt; in my folder! Thanks @nvie! Oh, wow, actually go follow him, that‚Äôs Vincent Driessen and he‚Äôs got a lot of great work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; I‚Äôm going to get going, because it‚Äôs saying the next automatic backup is in eleven minutes, so hopefully ‚Ä¶ know what, no ‚Äòhopefully‚Äô, auto backup off, I‚Äôm going to go and get beer before they won‚Äôt sell it (blue laws! Who‚Äôd a thunk?!) and we‚Äôll see if the file deletion is done yet when I get back! ‚Ä¶ ohh, I knocked the disk ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supplies requisitioned, dog walked again, food on the stove for dog, and I really thought this Time Machine thing was going to happen but now I‚Äôm really not sure it is. My back hurts, and it‚Äôs time to stop myself here. Tomorrow‚Äôs Monday! Work-type things are expected to be happening! The proverbial hammer just fell, too, very exciting week! Ask me about it over coffee! For now!:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes!
~g&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. Keeping on going, lol ‚Ä¶ must ‚Ä¶ get up and running ‚Ä¶ lol &lt;em&gt;everything‚Äôs&lt;/em&gt; breaking now, this is crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

Double pillows and feet up on the toolbox with some jeans on it, then the stand for the second monitor with a sweatshirt over my legs and between the two so the laptop doesn‚Äôt eventually fry my lap and is just a little elevated, and I think I can work and not have back pain for a bit, lol. I‚Äôve got a tray next to me with a sketch pad, notes, and pen, and snacks on the non-Dawa side, and a little bit here, and let‚Äôs see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm going to change how posts are structured, so I‚Äôll have a place for everyday journaling, and then I‚Äôm going to make more like ‚ÄòBlog Post‚Äô type blog posts on actual subjects, and eventually I‚Äôm going to make everything searchable and sorted nicely and all that jazz, but &lt;strong&gt;for the moment!:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, two things, actually, Dawa jumped over a like three foot maybe three plus foot fence today! It was awesome! He‚Äôs the best!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the other thing, oh, three things, what was the first one though so I don‚Äôt lose it ‚Ä¶ was it the apartment? Yes, I think so! I‚Äôve continued the clean of my apartment and within a very short time there are going to be no cardboard boxes in the middle of the floor and it‚Äôs going to be amazing! And the bathroom is going to get cleaned, vacuuming is going to get done, surfaces dusted ‚Ä¶ OOO and I switched the bulbs around, got a new extension cord and surge protector, and not the apartment is like properly lit, too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is crumbling around us, it would seem, so taking care to enjoy the small wins is crutial :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, coding! Oh, yea, and the third thing! I got &lt;a href=&quot;trailcity.net&quot;&gt;trailcity.net&lt;/a&gt; up as a Node/Express app very quickly! It‚Äôs still not like, there yet, and I took the server down I think, but oh my goodness, I used to not know wtf, but this time I kinda knew wtf and I was able to just &lt;strong&gt;do it!&lt;/strong&gt; Crazy!!! It was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; so long ago that touching a server was like physically painful because of the level of anxiety ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to get organized with work stuff and get my work stuff organized (which will be easier with a place that‚Äôs put together!) I‚Äôve got this website, which, whooof, needs work, that‚Äôs basically everything though, right?, and then trailcity.net slaaash Run Club, and then there‚Äôs the backing the computer up project, and there‚Äôs the getting back into React Native development, since that‚Äôs pretty hot and like, just having the devices/sim/emulators going at any point in time is a biggie, lol, and theeen ‚Ä¶ and then there‚Äôs the cover letter and applying places, and theeen ‚Ä¶ and then there‚Äôs continuing to hop on Discord/Twitter and be helpful/visible, and theeen ‚Ä¶ I dunno, there‚Äôs so much to think about inside each project, and those things so often are like directly relevant in any other project, or a set of other projects, and I just want to say I was hoping to get built those sites for sharing those e-books and the penguin thing, before finishing saying it‚Äôs not all about the individual projects :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder what sort of ToS agreement I‚Äôm going to have to write for Run Club right now? Like, ‚ÄúPLEASE DON‚ÄôT USE THIS RIGHT NOW, LITERALLY, IT‚ÄôS PROBABLY AGAINST THE LAW. DO NOT GATHER IN GROUPS IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. Just in case you want to beta-test it, or have a social/legal circumstance for this, here it is, though!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, &lt;strong&gt;positives!&lt;/strong&gt; Sure, the economy is tanking right now, but guess who‚Äôs going to have to have an online presence now for sure? Everyone! Hate to look for a silver lining amongst &lt;em&gt;sooo much death,&lt;/em&gt; lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm going to pull the energy from for the next stage of this cleaning process though. Or the next stage of the coding process, like ‚Ä¶ okay, in real life, still need to do the bathroom, and I didn‚Äôt get it in one go and now there are a few dishes in the sink and sooo many dishes got done, and then with gfcom like, I don‚Äôt know what my deal is with not wanting to upgrade my build/deploy pipeline, but the upload times are getting longer and longer and I‚Äôm not even doing it regularly anymore. It‚Äôs time, there, but like getting to that git diff and seeing like, oh, of course, I blow the ./public folder away to rebuild ‚Ä¶ That updates, though, I should be able to just delete ./.cache if I‚Äôm just adding a post and not doing anything fancy? Okay, I know the next test to run there ‚Ä¶ that was such a brick wall though ‚Ä¶ and then with the Run Club project, it‚Äôs just ‚Ä¶ eh, wah, wah, wah, call the wahmbulance. Got some routes. Routes need handlers. Handlers kind of a pain because they have to get data with Mongoose, and also I started working on them immediately after the course (except for the sass adventure? Maybe others? Notes project!) and didn‚Äôt have the juice to finish building everything up in one go. I can do this, though, and it‚Äôs all coming together. New resum√©, new (feel to the) apartment, wonderful new info coming down the line from the podcasts I listen to, which I absolutely need to make a widget/page for ‚Ä¶ must spend more time in design app! A hundred other thoughts! üôÉ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// So, turns out that was a recipe for a nap, lol. but I got some more dev stuff done later ‚Ä¶ I wish I had budgeted the energy for a wrapup, just dipped my toes in the contenerization world, it‚Äôs wild. Anyway,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes!

If I have a comic where I wear different hats throughout the day by being different characters, robo-Gareth is definitely in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I‚Äôm blocking out a good chunk of time here ‚Ä¶ hahaha ‚Ä¶ I wrote chuck ‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs character #4 of the Run Club test data, so I‚Äôm #1, and then I‚Äôm using Alice, Bob, Chuck, Dave, Eve (the evesdropper) all down the security/cryptography chain of characters, until Judy for the moment, lol ‚Ä¶ anyway, I‚Äôve got a good chunk for coding here, and I‚Äôm going to start by picking something in a different direction entirely! Okay maybe ‚Ä¶ twenty minutes unless I decide I‚Äôm going to reorganize ~/Code, and then thirty minutes to work on data and that, from the next hour, in two minutes, 11, go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, my ~/ScreenCaps is over 50mb, should probably try the TimeMachine things again after cleaning my hard drive, holy moley!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so maybe like 40 minutes, and I know where I‚Äôll pick up next time, which is to try and make a react app that counts the pages! Next segment should be what‚Äôs eating at my mind, which is acceptBudsRequest with strings, which should not be causing me that much stress, but there we have it, lol.&lt;/p&gt;

So many tabs open!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ooo, I should include the description in the start of the post more often, as if you go right to the link you don‚Äôt see it, but it‚Äôs definitely part of like the theme!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Googleing the options for autoCompleteBrackets, why on EARTH did I have it on ‚Äúnever‚Äù! I don‚Äôt know what ‚ÄúlanguageDependant‚Äù, which of course hope to find out one day, but I went ‚Äúalways‚Äù for now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prettier config ‚Ä¶ oh my God, the guy next store is singing and ffaaeeeeeeeeling it! Hoo ‚Ä¶ hooo-boy. That was also the case at like 4 in the morning, when I decided to get up, which is how we got to me starting this post in just the early afternoon with just ‚ÄòStrings.‚Äô Lot going on in code-land though, lol. Can‚Äôt wait to chop up some JSX and make some libraries work again. This is not coming as easily as I thought. The next thing I learn, I need to a better job with taking it in. I think the standing desk, it‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; to get more productivity, good creative work though, I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôd have to be on a good back pain day, lol. Anyway, prettier config, like which is spaces between brackets and arguments? That‚Äôs a later thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next tab‚Äôs question can die, and then I‚Äôll hear someone use the word, and I‚Äôll be like aha! In episode 454 ..!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mongoose query methods have a .lean() that might be what you want depending on how your query is structured!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, pulling and adding to set in MongoDB, it worked before when it was just strings, and running .save() when you can is recommended, n‚Äôest pas? Twelve tabs for this. This is why ‚ÄúStrings.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm going to make another sticky note. I‚Äôve got ‚ÄúCommit early, commit often!‚Äù, ‚ÄúConst till you Can‚Äôt!‚Äù, and now I‚Äôll have ‚ÄúAdd cursor to all instances of current selection|: Cmd + Shift + L Selection| meow!‚Äù Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaand GitHub Issues, right, that‚Äôs where I have to start putting a bunch of stuff for a ‚Äòlater‚Äô category, as it gets ready to be fleshed out and made all nice. Okay, and then I‚Äôve listed out all the code, at least the controllers, haven‚Äôt hit views yet, and haven‚Äôt fleshed out all the routes, actually, either, like, yea, no, there is no /runner/:id, what, crazy. I collapsed all of the code chunks in all of the controllers though, we‚Äôre gonna get &lt;em&gt;organized!&lt;/em&gt; Also we‚Äôve got runner-, user-, and authControllers, and Run.js and User.js are the models, so maybe we can do something about that, but remember we can‚Äôt just do a project-wide search of User and switch it to Runner, definitely not with node_modules installed, lol. Doh. Not making that mistake again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So unless the third time was going to be the charm there, my other hard drive isn‚Äôt doing the time-machine swap thing, and I‚Äôm maybe wondering that the size of the drive was too much for it, or the disk that‚Äôs in there, so I‚Äôm going to have to figure that out, but first I need to ‚Ä¶ omg my puppy just flopped upside-down, looked at me for reassurance, and then closed his eyes again and continued snoozing ‚Ä¶ umm ‚Ä¶ okay, first I need to handle the rest of the node code (I KNOOOW!!) because people will never see my machine being totally backed up, but if I don‚Äôt plow through this server-side stuff and get to the front-end, I‚Äôm like not going to get a job, and I‚Äôm a little nervous at the moment, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sooo, I‚Äôve got a helpful list of what the wanted user actions to be, at least, and GitHub issues for the various parts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Umm, okay, first wtf of the day, buds requests are being accepted and buds added, but the page is still rendering the buds requests ‚Ä¶ I do not understand. Lol I‚Äôm Eve‚Äôs bud so many times now ‚Ä¶ okay at acceptBudRequest, which was totally working until I moved away from storing strings, lol, anyway, at acceptBudRequest at runnerController ‚Ä¶ eugh, okay, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;. I fought for that &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, lol it was &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;user.buds.toString()[0].includes(otherRunnerIdString)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cool, the project is at the point where I can start to go through as a user and the dead ends will actually represent what‚Äôs needed next, I took the fluff out for the most part. Yay!

&lt;p&gt;// Huh! Skipped a lot of day there before checking back with ye ole blog! Run accomplished and major resume overhaul! Ever read something you wrote and feel sure that you remembered getting to an acceptable level of done-ness, but having read it again can only ask, ‚ÄúI wrote this?‚Äù I mean, in programming, too though, right? I looked back to my first project folders from 2015, and not stuff I‚Äôm super proud of, lol. Looking forward to the next refactor/editing, the next piece of work is authoring though, I need to write a cover letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, let‚Äôs think of what variables there will be ‚Ä¶ my values will align with each company a little differently, so there‚Äôs some room there for why me and company BCD are a good fit ‚Ä¶ then there‚Äôs the tech, I‚Äôll be more-or-less aligned with companies there ‚Ä¶ and then there‚Äôs like, whether I feel like any color matters, or whether bog-standard is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lol, tweaker-man is having an all-out fit out there. Right, well, I missed writing about a lot from earlier, but that I got the resume totally re-done is huge, and I don‚Äôt know how much more I‚Äôm going to get done tonight, and I haven‚Äôt posted for a few days, so I‚Äôm going to save and try to post and if I write more I‚Äôll update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if people ever ship js that‚Äôs writing over the css just to back it up, lol. Now that I‚Äôve been reading more BEM-style code I think I could go with that. It is kinda wordy, but not like, reaaalllyyy. // Oo, yay, spent a minute cleaning up my dotfiles, that felt good. Hadn‚Äôt really been in there since zsh. And oh no, it doesn‚Äôt translate through the ‚Ä¶ I was going to say, but I upgraded node and haven‚Äôt run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gatsby develop&lt;/code&gt; on this project since ‚Ä¶ anyway ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, I need to close tabs now and make sure I get the important things done. Save what I was looking into, though, good stuff here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point I should go through image url(‚Äú./yourSrc.png‚Äù) and the backhand shorthand that can go after the source. &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background&quot;&gt;MDN: background&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hero-generator.netlify.app/&quot;&gt;Hero-generator.netlify.app&lt;/a&gt; is a cool dev tool from Sarah Drasner &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sarah_edo&quot;&gt;@sarah_edo on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and I wonder if I can make something like that for like text‚Ä¶ I always have to futz with it, if I‚Äôm going for something specific ‚Ä¶ anyway this is where the backhand shorthand questions came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://date-fns.org/&quot;&gt;Date-fns,&lt;/a&gt; I was going to replace Moment for the kb ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yoannfleurydev/cra-template-chakra-ui&quot;&gt;Create-react-app Chakra UI template!&lt;/a&gt; If you‚Äôve seen Chakra UI (I have!) and like create-react-app! (I do!) you‚Äôd be as excited by this as I am right now! I should start a whole folder for starters, at this point! Folder time is coming, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/today-i-learned-chai/building-a-simple-chat-application-with-node-js-and-socket-io-a7d7b38fd028&quot;&gt;This is the chat with Socket.IO I was going to go through to add chat to runs,&lt;/a&gt; I think this might be like almost next. I think making the landing page logic and having that look decent is next? Or at least the logic, like if the user has runs coming up, otherwise same space for going to new runs, and if their buds have any upcoming runs, buds with runs, otherwise same space for getting new buds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there was Gulp ‚Ä¶ also, I ended up with an app that‚Äôs like a shell on my phone. It‚Äôs got Python, C, and C++, and it‚Äôs basically a shell but not technically. &lt;a href=&quot;https://holzschu.github.io/a-Shell_iOS/&quot;&gt;aShell. Wild.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so that‚Äôs the browser tabs, the real next step should be fixing what‚Äôs going on with this very website‚Äôs build tool, because I updated Node and now &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gatsby develop&lt;/code&gt; doesn‚Äôt work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; the next thing to fix up should be my resume and CV, and &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; responding to that email. So we‚Äôll start there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, email responded to ‚Ä¶ and I think resume/CV are going to be what I have to get through before coding tomorrow when I have more energy, I trained and trained Dawa today and I‚Äôm like totally pooped. I know they were supposed to be afternoon-stuff yesterday, you wouldn‚Äôt believe how yesterday ended up going in the evening, though, I‚Äôll tell you about it over a beer or three sometime, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes!

So I took two days off from coding, and made a nine-week plan for various aspects of my life on Saturday, and took a day‚Ä¶]]></description><link>https://www.garethfield.com/back-at-it/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.garethfield.com/back-at-it/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2020 07:28:11 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Good morning!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I took two days off from coding, and made a nine-week plan for various aspects of my life on Saturday, and took a day yesterday to be a no-screens day, and now I‚Äôm refreshed and ready to go! Relatively refreshed, at least, the saga with tweaker-man continues and like ‚Ä¶ those were two days I didn‚Äôt get any work-work done and that‚Äôs a little stressful to think about, but I really think I needed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I‚Äôm going through what I need to get done on the back end for the Run Club project to be done enough so that the next step is the front end refactor, then I‚Äôm going to update my resume and write a cover letter, and aggregate more places to apply. Next up is handling the front end of this website, because it‚Äôs not exactly a great selling point for me as a dev, and then I‚Äôll be in front end mode when I come back to Run Club, and I‚Äôll feel better about sending out stronger applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the landing page as authed/non-authed is a todo, more runner info and deleting one‚Äôs account, updating the run page with chat, the runs listing page needs data to come back sorted for a map and table, the buds list needs more info and chat, and runner pages in general, and the my runs page needs data coming in sorted for a map and table, too. Aaand go! //&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, landing page for authed/non-authed, handled, more or less, on to getting the profile filled out. I have to make a decision on how I‚Äôm going to do this, actually, but first I have to get myself together, get a workout in, and walk Dawa again. C‚Äôest la vie avec un chiene, lol! //&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eugh, the amount that I did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; want to do that workout, lol. Got a plan though, and I‚Äôm sticking to it! Okay, made some lunch, made some coffee (first French press of the Ethiopia Sidama my sister gave me! Omg! It‚Äôs like ‚Ä¶ okay, possible NSFW here, but it‚Äôs like a tangerine ‚Ä¶ no, nevermind. It‚Äôs quite good!) ‚Ä¶ and code time! //&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, boy, that was an adventure. Updated the info that‚Äôs on the user account, and added some super-super-super ugly logic for whether it‚Äôs the first time they‚Äôre going to the edit account (profile) page ‚Ä¶ but it works, and it‚Äôs time to walk Dawa again! üê∂ Next up is chat! Oh boy, lol. Doesn‚Äôt look too bad he said?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Yo so I‚Äôm looking through various new stuff, and if you want to go on a tripm check &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/misterunknown/ifm&quot;&gt;this out! Improved File Manager (IFM)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I took the morning to get some things over to my sister‚Äôs and train, I‚Äôm all set though, Dawa‚Äôs all set, just got some food in me, have some tea here, fabuloso! Next up is finishing off making sure my machine is backed up before I write those database queries, and then actually I need to do a little planning before that so I can have a better picture of what I‚Äôm doing here. I had a plan a few weeks ago, and it‚Äôs been a good few weeks, I think I‚Äôm a little off the rails, though. Memorial day was yesterday, feels like a great time to dive in headfirst!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.. Lol which I did! Downloading upgrades and backing things up was apparently not much to write home about though.&lt;/p&gt;

Fighting depression today, blah. Dawa had a nice walk this morning though, we went to the park, there were some other dogs and nice people and we got some running around in. I‚Äôm looking forward to the next cup of coffee, I think I‚Äôm going to open the bag of Ethiopian. Coding time, though. I think I‚Äôll just comment out the parts of the website I‚Äôm not working on so I don‚Äôt get distracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, database stuff ‚Ä¶ I think I thought of the least efficient way to build a query ever ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going to put myself together, take Dawa out for another walk, and try again. // Ahhh, I always get the right idea when I get up from the desk and do something else lolll&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh I‚Äôm so glad I took another little break right then, they just started mowing the grass outside, I‚Äôm so on edge I think if I were trying to concentrate I‚Äôd have had a conniption, lol&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm. Footgunned myself. I did a project-wide find and replace of User to Runner and user to runner ‚Ä¶ think I broke it ‚Ä¶ git reset ‚Äîhard HEAD it is, lol ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, well ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think I understand why you‚Äôd save like, in the example app, the store ‚Äòauthor‚Äô is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;{ type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId, ref: &amp;quot;User&amp;quot; }&lt;/code&gt; and I was doing that with friends lists, and using the _id as a string was much simpler ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a reason, but I don‚Äôt know what it could be ‚Ä¶ I should take a seperate course on MongoDB/Mongoose mastery, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phew, okay, got the whole friends list thing going. Rock and roll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes!

And now, like he said, we‚Äôve built the last controller method, and this little caterpillar has turned into a properly syntax-highlighted butterfly and will take to the wind!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boyoo, did I not want to get up early today or exercise, though. Did it though! Rock and roll!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lol, and like the first thing I try and do with Pug is trivial in React, but I have to be like wait no ‚Ä¶ how? What? Okay, so I can barely think with how my dog is right now, but hopefully my fingers can do the thinking right now. You need the pug file to conditionally render forms ‚Ä¶ oh my god, tweaker man, the neighbors, and the dog all at once, I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm giving up and throwing some YouTube on until I can calm down, lol, this is ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;/// Post-script from the next day! Yeap! Didn‚Äôt get any more work done yesterday! Honestly I‚Äôm going through some depression right now. I‚Äôve been pretty good until now with the pandemic going on and what it‚Äôs meant for me, but I have to say the past few days ‚Ä¶ I mean yesterday it really hit, it was &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; hard to be productive in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, feels good to have said it, even to the ether, and I‚Äôm going to get up and do my best now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes!

The coffee is amazing this morning, thanks to my sister, and thanks to the camesinos! Diving right in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rocking and rolling! Geospatial API endpoints, plotting places on a custom Google map, pushing user data to the API, displaying pages based on that user data ‚Ä¶ pretty exciting stuff! Maybe a little over-caffeinated here, which is having the effect of putting me to sleep, so I think it‚Äôs stir-fry time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;//&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, okay, so stir-fry went great, &lt;em&gt;second tech interview&lt;/em&gt; also went great! Solid maybe on this one! Definitely still getting used to video call interviews ‚Ä¶ like, would definitely rather meet inperson, it‚Äôs just so much easier with social cues, I have a hard enough time as it is, but while I was nervous, I knew what to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; with the nervousness a little better ‚Ä¶ Alright, well tomorrow I have to hit the ground running again, I think I‚Äôm done-zow for today. Polish off advanced relationship population, advanced aggregation, and implementing pagination, then the deployment episodes, and I‚Äôm glad the series hits on Heroku a bit, that‚Äôs what this place I interviewed at was using ‚Ä¶ along with Python, PostGres ‚Ä¶ did I hear Django, or was I hallucinating? Definitely React Native, and Stripe, and Twillio, so that‚Äôs no worries, and it doesn‚Äôt sound like they were going to pay as much as like the last place I interviewed at, but getting paid was definitely on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy crap, the bass is &lt;em&gt;bumping&lt;/em&gt; upstairs! They‚Äôve been going since like 5, it‚Äôs like 7, and I‚Äôm just going to whistle along ‚Ä¶ what else can I do? I mean, it‚Äôs a Tuesday, who can blame them? Who would waste a Tuesday? We only live so long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes,

Got a workout in today, and got Dawa out for a short run, just 1 mile. I gotta say, doing a workout in my apartment is like, not my favorite thing in the world, but I‚Äôve got to get in shape, and I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; feel better afterwards. Now that the blood is flowing, time to debug. I wrote way too much code without testing yesterday. Whoops! This is one of the reasons I really need to exercise, though, if I haven‚Äôt, I can get in this rush where I feel I‚Äôve got to go a million miles an hour and cram as much productivity as I can in, when in reality I need to hold my horses, put on my thinking cap, and cultivate the part of my mind thinks &lt;em&gt;slow.&lt;/em&gt; (Highly recommend Daniel Kahneman‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/books/thinking-fast-and-slow/9780374533557&quot;&gt;Thinking, Fast And Slow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On with the show!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Jeez, Louise, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; only took an &lt;em&gt;hour&lt;/em&gt; ‚Ä¶ I forgot to append &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;enctype=&amp;quot;multipart/form-data&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; to the form, that‚Äôs why there was no &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;req.file&lt;/code&gt; ‚Ä¶ eugh, not used to having seperate files for views, lol. I miss React. Thought I was going totally bonkers there. Ok, with it then! ‚Ä¶ And yay! Just had to change two route names, and it all works perfectly, password reset and all! //&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun! AJAX requests, API endpoints, and defence against XSS attacks! Only like two hours left of course material, and then I get pushed off the dock, as it were! Must rest, though, lol, let that sink in, then I‚Äôll reapply it to the other project. Have to go through more potential job applications, too, it‚Äôs like that early afternoon slump where that‚Äôs all my mind is good for, more or less. Pretty stoked for cooking dinner later, too, I‚Äôm going to do some stir-fry, beans, and rice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Huh, so, totally had an adventure today, and my soul is replenished for tomorrow, but I‚Äôd pictured getting more work done after, had this whole plan, no way though. Not happening. I‚Äôm definitely like alert and with it at the time that I‚Äôd planned to be alert and with it, because tomorrow at this time I‚Äôve got an interview (yay!) but it‚Äôs an hour to the trail, ran for an hour, reinjured my ankle, lol, totally worth it though, and an hour back, and my everything hurts, sitting in this chair is done in like T-minus ten, and I‚Äôm not even going to cook dinner, I walked Dawa, made him dinner, and I‚Äôm going to sit with a book until Dawa gets me to take him out again, and then I‚Äôm zonking out. Supposed to rain tomorrow, anyway. The beans and rice and stir-fry can happen after the morning coding sesh, and they‚Äôd better because I have no other food now, lol. Goodnight!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And best wishes!

Walked Dawa, got a letter off to my neice, let‚Äôs get to it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are we doing ‚Ä¶ we got registration down, just need to go over login/logout middleware, reset password flow, and then today we learn about sending email from Node! (The &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; exciting stuff, I know ‚Ä¶ I think I‚Äôve spent a good quarter of my time coding on user authentication and that type of thing at this point, oh well, is what it is :) Oh, protected routes, too, and virtual fields, right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, busted that out, put myself together, walked Dawa again and went through some job listings, onto the next lesson in the course!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dope, so still in dev-mode, but at least it‚Äôs sending out fake emails, figured relational data out, time to reapply to the other project ‚Ä¶ //&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coded for a while, and when I come back, I must solve the mystery of photo uploads, test the tags page, and test the password reset flow! I can‚Äôt sit anymore for the moment though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boyoo, there are a lot of companies that start with ‚ÄòBio‚Äô ‚Ä¶ so I went through a bunch more potential job listings, and I worked on getting my backup machine up to snuff, I‚Äôm really tired though and don‚Äôt feel like pushing more caffeine into my system, so I‚Äôm going to give myself a break for the rest of the evening. I‚Äôm going to spatchcock a chicken. Tomorrow I‚Äôm going to get a workout in, and Tuesday I‚Äôm going to get in a run to destress before the interview, is the plan. Leh‚Äôgo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes,

&lt;p&gt;A good cup of coffee can make a world of difference! Woke up today totally blah, because I went into the comments section on a Reddit post last night (big mistake, lol) and didn‚Äôt get a lot of sleep, and then my daylight bulb went on &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; as I was starting to dream, but it turns out the very last type of whole bean coffee at Stop and Shop, which I‚Äôd previously avoided because it‚Äôs marketed as ‚ÄúPatriot‚Äôs Blend‚Äù and I thought would be a dark roast for sure, is actually a light roast and while not exceptional, is a tasty brew! Light on the tongue, not a whole lot up front, but a distinct nutty wash ‚Ä¶ which rather brings it around to the Reddit post ‚Ä¶ but let‚Äôs get the party started here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also realized that I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; this, again, today. I can‚Äôt &lt;em&gt;wait&lt;/em&gt; to get coding in the morning, and it‚Äôs been what I‚Äôve been doing every morning since I got my mornings back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so, get to parity with the tutorial project: create the register get and post routes, create the register page template, create the user and auth controllers, create the user model, register the user model with mongoose, check that it‚Äôs working, go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Btw, I‚Äôve been listening to &lt;strong&gt;tofubeats&lt;/strong&gt; rather than lo-fi, and I &lt;em&gt;dig it!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and set up the passport handler and require that in app.js, right!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sahweet! Typed like mad for an hour and only wrote in four bugs! Got user registration! I love the part where you‚Äôre cementing knowledge, way less work than the first part, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Brr, brisk out! Got 4.5mi in though. I could‚Äôve done a workout here, but I‚Äôm just spending so much time in the apartment these days ‚Ä¶ listened to Dr. Jane Goodall being interviewed though! Holey moly! What a jump cable of grounding and hope! If you‚Äôre looking for it, and do, it‚Äôs The Tim Ferriss Show, which I don‚Äôt often listen to, but he gets the most amazing guests on sometimes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, back to it, back to ‚Ä¶ Virtual Field, login/logout middleware, and protected routes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awesome, got all the way through user account screen and password reset flow, next up is sending email from node! But I‚Äôm at the point where the next step is getting my other project to parity, and I should probably apply to some jobs. I‚Äôve got Oluwatobitowa on the line though, hopefully he‚Äôs working on init-ing his git repository. Sometimes I respond to him and I‚Äôm not sure he‚Äôs got it ‚Ä¶ OH there he is, yay! AWW his power is out again! WTF!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Lol, so I just poured my heart out into the various questions for the Automattic application ‚Ä¶ then saw that a cover letter was required ‚Ä¶ so I drafted up a .txt saying to please read the answers to the questions in more-or-less letter format ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll get that one, lol. Maybe, I did kinda go on about stuff I do that‚Äôs very much aligned with their values. I‚Äôve gone through the ‚ÄòA‚Äôs though, so I‚Äôm going to arm myself with a cover letter, possibly commit a few hours to tidying up my portfolio site, and then take another stab at the list. Also, do not do important things when you are tired or hungry ‚Ä¶ &lt;strong&gt;when will I learn!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, so I‚Äôm winding down, but I should just mention that listening to that podcast totally saved my day, also the TrailRunner Nation with Simon Marshall and Lesley Paterson on how the brain works, and also Books I‚Äôve Loved with Matt Mullenweg, whose company I applied to today, lol. I want to keep the routine going through tomorrow morning at least, since I‚Äôm at such a perfect point here, but I‚Äôm definitely primed for some big changes, I feel. For now, over and out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And best wishes!

So first off, I want to get some of the styling changed so that this thing kinda &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; like mine, and then I‚Äôll want to work on it more. Not that I don‚Äôt want to work on it, but when someone else wrote all the styles, you know, it‚Äôs just like ‚Ä¶ what is this? Next is colors, then icons, but first, the serif font looks &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; next ot the sans-serif font! I love the sans-serif font, Hattori Hanzo, but Artifika next to it looks totally whack ‚Ä¶ okay Museo is dope, I‚Äôm going to try it out, and if I have to buy the license later, so be it, I‚Äôve got up to 500,000 page views per month for a website for now, with the 500 weight Museo Slab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yea! So good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, I replaced the sass variables I blew away yesterday, I‚Äôm not going to worry about swapping all of that over right now though. Icons ‚Ä¶ Oh so good! SVG is still a mystery to me, but I can dig into them at least a little bit nowadays!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// AHHH Dawa got me out for a walk but wouldn‚Äôt walk, and one of his pads is kinda raw! I think I need to give him a chill pill at some point, he‚Äôs used to being so active, but both a) the load on him is just different since we started training, and b) I have to &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; this thing! Just quit my other job, definitely go-time, lol!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the plan for the moment though is to get to parity, then plow through the course to get to users, and that‚Äôs where the game changes. There‚Äôs a dozen-plus videos after that, definitely email, definitely setting up the api, deployment, conquering user-land is a biggie though. Go go go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, thank goodness, I did it. All store stuff is now run stuff, no bugs, beautiful, leh-go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving on with the course, learning about file uploads and chaining middleware ‚Ä¶ and I finally used this blog as a reference, yay! I was getting an error that photo.resize wasn‚Äôt a function, so I copied in the stepped solution and it worked, but I couldn‚Äôt spot what had changed, so I went back and looked up how to diff between the current and previous commits, made a temp folder, and I‚Äôd forgotten to &lt;em&gt;await&lt;/em&gt; jump.read(req.file.buffer) ‚Ä¶ silly me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Alrighty, got through aggregation! That was a doozy! Think I more-or-less got it though, good thing I‚Äôve already done some work with chaining map-reduce-filter, so that‚Äôs not really that foreign to me! It‚Äôs been a few hours though and I‚Äôm starting to lose concentration, so it‚Äôs cleaning party time! Woo! // And back to it :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple queries in a controller, dope, cool to see Promise.all in the wild. And on to user accounts! And soup!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaand we‚Äôve got registering a user! More or less! Still getting some jankiness in error states, like the request body doesn‚Äôt seem to repopulate the fields, and different errors are handled either by the form or by flashes, but the happy path works, failures are handled one way or another, beautiful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saw that one job made up and disappeared, applied for another, walked Dawa, cooked for Dawa, finished the dishes, broke one of the glass chambers for my French presses, started a list of things I‚Äôm going to buy when I have a job in tech, and gooood night!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes!
~g&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, P.S., Dawa had an awesome little play-sesh with Pepper and Lola, and I think it‚Äôs probably just his pad worn down than any real damage, crossing my fingers and thank God! I saw him limp a little today and my heart dropped, and I‚Äôd thought I‚Äôd really hurt him, but I think he‚Äôs good! Eep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.P.S. Two applications, yay, g.&lt;/p&gt;

Search ‚Äòcity pop‚Äô on Spotify!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, Dawa and I got in nine and a half miles at a pretty good pace there, hence the title, but now I‚Äôm going to get super cereal up in here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spent just a moment going over a free landing page template built in React from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cruip/open-react-template&quot;&gt;Cruip&lt;/a&gt; that was on HackerNews, just to get my head into coding mode ‚Ä¶ pretty good stuff! Definitely going to keep it around as a reference!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was I doing? I picked out some fonts, and I should just pull over the icons from the other project and throw them in there, and try and get this thing up and running. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Just get the fonts, colors, and icons up, he said. Quick task, he said. Hundreds of lines of code later ‚Ä¶ Oh well, strong attention to detail in front-end code. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs gonna make the bread. Oooh, speaking of food ‚Ä¶ okay, another fifteen minutes, then I put some soup on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// ‚Ä¶ OOOHHHKAY wtf. Having one of those days where I felt pretty good and like I was going to make a lot of progress, and I‚Äôm running into weird bugs trying to get the flipping thing to just not give me any errors in the console. I went as far as to just copy-paste the whole dependencies/dev-dependencies from the other package.json, since bringing mongoose back down solved one bug, and it did solve another bug, so it‚Äôs all bundling into dist now, but it‚Äôs changing the headers of the request after received from the client and it‚Äôs complaining? I‚Äôm cloning the whole darn project again and trying it, maybe it‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know ‚Ä¶ rough day, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Dog is walked again, dog is fed, project is broken and I have no idea why, and here‚Äôs the plan: commit the code, new branch, nuke it, copy in the starter files, add the stuff I added, see when it breaks, or if it breaks, go from there. Go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶ God damnit. I just deleted all of my work from today. Okay, welp. Take two. üé¨&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OH NO! EVERYTHING WAS STILL IN CACHE IN VSCODE AND THEN I BLEW &lt;strong&gt;THAT&lt;/strong&gt; AWAY! I‚ÄôM A FULL-BLOWN IDIOT! üò¢ FUCK! // AND I WAS ON THE MASTER BRANCH WHEN I MADE ALL THE NEW CHANGES! AHHHH!!! ‚Ä¶ AND THE REACT BRANCH WAS OVERWRITTEN. WHAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v74-0GON0go&quot; title=&quot;What The Fuck&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img.youtube.com/vi/v74-0GON0go/0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Nichijou Shrine Incident&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶ and Dawa needs to go out again. What. The. Fuck. Shoot me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// OKAY ROUND WHATEVER, GO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt even know where to start right now ‚Ä¶ fonts?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Done, I‚Äôm done. Donzowski. Today doesn‚Äôt go down as a good day except that we absolutely did get that run in, and I‚Äôm going to set my alarm for early tomorrow, hopefully I get some sleep tonight. Oh, actually, you know what? I totally booked another interview, I keep on mentally glossing over that, it‚Äôs like big news though. I‚Äôm going to put in my two weeks at Starbucks before that though, and I‚Äôm frankly just scared and bitter and all sorts of negativity right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cereally, best wishes though,

Afternoon. It‚Äôs been a day, so far, but I need to jump right in, here. I got a Google Maps key to work with, went through the last video in the Geolocation section in the Learn Node series, and I looked at a few examples of how people used CRA and Express together, I think what I‚Äôm going to do though, to cement my knowledge, get something functional up, and get used to refactoring, and not have to galaxy-brain today because for whatever reason I‚Äôm just not filled with energy and creativity today, is to start up another branch of run-club-web where I basically remake it how Wes has Dang That‚Äôs Delicious set up at this point in the series, and then refactor it after that. Ready, set, go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, you know what, I‚Äôm just going to rename it dep-run-club-web and make the git repo private, now I know how to use dotenv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Oof, hours later! I think I‚Äôve got everything in &lt;em&gt;relatively&lt;/em&gt; minimalistically, just need to put the fonts in and get some icons going. And yes, I read the webpack config! Which I might not otherwise have, lol. Oh boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; it‚Äôs a job application party, or as my mother would‚Äôve said, a partay. :) Made sure I got supplies, got some soup in, walked Dawa, fed Dawa, got some music going, drinks, snacks, aaand apply to jobs time! Aaand my Internet cuts out, nice :) ‚Ä¶ It came back :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Well, I only tied the number of applications I put out yesterday, but several were from the ‚Äòtier 1‚Äô list today, and I spent extra time on them! Got back from the after chow-time walk with Dawa and our across-the-way neighbor was in handcuffs! Wonder what we missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a good point to pick up again tomorrow, going to sign out for now and call it a night, stoked for an early day tomorrow though! Dawa and I had a day off from our runs, which have been getting longer, and I‚Äôve been going for long enough here I know what a good next route will be!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes!

I had a dream I didn‚Äôt feel like having two of, so up we got! Aaand it‚Äôs reading from the database time! // And updating! // And putting myself together and running with Dawa! // And making soup! Should be good! Garlic, onions, celery, broccoli, mushroom, carrot, tomato, olive oil, white pepper, tumeric, ginger powder, hot mexican chili pepper, curry powder, basil, bay leaf, thyme, oregano, salt, oh and a little white vinegar and the last of the haba√±ero salsa. It‚Äôs going to be soup for a while though, because of the coronavirus, I can‚Äôt share any. üò¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On with the show, though! I think I got through all of the core stuff, I‚Äôm going to plow through the rest here, and rock and roll! //&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alrighty, got through some more data types and how client-side scripts go in this project, went out and mailed in some license plates, requisitioned supplies, walked Dawa again, and now I‚Äôm trying to apply for jobs, and my Internet is just &lt;em&gt;crawling,&lt;/em&gt; like I‚Äôve been trying to load an about page for coming up on five minutes. I applied to five jobs yesterday, I‚Äôm going to punt and try and apply for ten today ‚Ä¶ holy crap, the footer just loaded before this form I‚Äôm trying to use, shoot me. I mean, they could use a developer, that‚Äôs for sure, lol. Lol, wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// NOPE, seven. We got seven in. Try again tomorrow. Today‚Äôs been a day, between waking up mad early to code, increasing the milage with Dawa, dealing with the DMV, finding out that my federal tax return was automatically applied to student loans without my being informed, and the soul-sucking process of applying to jobs I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm not even going to get a response from, I‚Äôm done-done-donezowski. I‚Äôm going to walk Dawa, cook for him when we get back, then dive back into the Node course with the rest of my hypothetically remaining energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;/// It‚Äôs the next day, I was done :\ Best wishes! ~g&lt;/p&gt;

I‚Äôm going to jump right into it, because after spending four and a half hours tutoring someone in React last night, I feel like I need to race to get my place back here. I‚Äôd just ‚Ä¶ what did I do ‚Ä¶ set up Mongo? Yea, the server was talking to Mongo, I think I was halfway through how to update documents with the NodeJS driver ‚Ä¶ Oof, &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; step back though, I kept on having to look up how to do basic things and look up how class components looked, lol. Yay programming. Yea, as I close my tabs, this.handleChange.bind(this), what‚Äôs the syntax and where do you put it ‚Ä¶ How to use fetch to update state in a class component ‚Ä¶ Do we need to use super() or super(props) in the constructor ‚Ä¶ &lt;strong&gt;What are the attributes of an input, type ‚Äòtext‚Äô, lol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, that one I think I knew, and was just showing them the docs at MDN. They were super smart, totally followed along with the concepts I was going over pretty quickly, brought correct terminology back around later in the conversation, and again, we were rocking and rolling for four and a half hours straight there, and you could tell they didn‚Äôt have a whole lot of experience with like, typing, much less the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, git, CLI, and React parts. I did my best, I really hope they do well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OKAY MONGO TIME, DO NO MORE PROCRASTINATING.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yay, I‚Äôm on fiyah this morning! üî• Also I feel like the Mongo driver docs just played me into Googleing, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs upsert?‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúNot much man, what‚Äôs up with you? (Says Sert)‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, sweet, tutorial time over, make stuff time. // Ooohkay, so I clearly need to restructure the routes and the connection, but I‚Äôm going to take a break, do some dishes, walk Dawa, and come back to this with a fresh mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, eff it, it‚Äôs @wesbos time. I can‚Äôt &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; afford this, but I can buy it, and I need a little boost right now. #learnNode!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, if my internet could come back, that would be great. ‚Ä¶ Thank you hotspot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Dang, nature, you scary! It‚Äôs crazy out there, the busted gutter I told them about in Febuary got blown off the roof, the rain is coming in through the (closed) patio door, trees all gone cray, hod‚Äôdan‚Äô!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, so I applied for five jobs today, and it was all &lt;strong&gt;terrifying!&lt;/strong&gt; I ended up going back to the Node course, and I‚Äôm like a fifth of the way through. The templating language is weird! I guess pug/jade is popular, but whooaaa so weird!&lt;/p&gt;

So‚Ä¶]]></description><link>https://www.garethfield.com/easter-eggs/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.garethfield.com/easter-eggs/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 12 Apr 2020 10:11:12 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Good morning! It‚Äôs beautiful out, Dawa and I got a run in, and I‚Äôm going to work on Run Club for the web for a bit, because I want to. So there! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just learned that React Router and Reach Router are going to be combined, and that React Router is going to be the surviving product, but it‚Äôs going to have a new hooks-based API brought out in a minor release ‚Ä¶ //&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohhhkay, so, it‚Äôs somewhat later, and I‚Äôve ‚Ä¶ what did I do? I‚Äôve gone through the Auth0 single-page-app and API setup, which was new again since hooks and context became big, the code is so much cleaner, but I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve been using hooks and context for a little bit, or I‚Äôd have no idea what the heck was going on. Yay for the Node code being easier to read, too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan now is that I‚Äôm going to go with Mongo, so I can say I know the MERN stack, and people know what that means, and I can find plenty of content to learn it, and if I want to go back to Hapi and RethinkDB at some point, it can be to test perf, and that looks good, too. Uhh, anyway, the &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; larger picture is that I‚Äôm going to set up some UI prepping for a set of CRUD operations, then get the database going and test everything locally, then I‚Äôm going to learn how to use environment variables and nuke my git history so I can make the repositories (and that I‚Äôm working on them) public without giving out keys and privite IP addresses, all that good stuff, then I‚Äôm going to get the SPA up on Linode, get the A record and C-Name and nginx and node and all that jazz set up for trailcity.net, then I‚Äôm going to get the express server up, then the DB, test it all in prod, as it were, and then we‚Äôre off to the races. Set up a continuous integration flow, set a sprint up, and get to the continuously integrating!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve also got to sort through the job listings, and cook and do dishes and take care of the dog, and I‚Äôm going to set myself the reward of taking Dawa to the trail when I‚Äôve applied to some jobs. Got down to the bridge on route to requisitioning supplies today, and took note of how wide the narrow parts of the pedestrian/bike path are, and I‚Äôm pretty sure I can get the trailer through, though I wouldn‚Äôt want to try it at speed, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway! Next step, some UI! I should have a route for new runs (new adventures? I feel like it would be a missed opportunity not to abstract ‚Ä¶ T minus thirty to adventure time! üòÜ) and a route for runs where you could update and delete (and read.) I think Bumble‚Äôs got it down with the three tab thing right now. Aaanyway ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, wow, still not-so-much support for datetime-local in Firefox, Safari, or IE, I mean, IE no surprise, but it not being in Firefox or Safari ‚Ä¶ oh well, date and time work in Firefox and Safari, we‚Äôre going with that. And Formik, hooray!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// I‚Äôm taking such small steps here, but steps they are! Oh boy ‚Ä¶ how do we use fetch? What sort of request am I making? How do I send a payload? What do I include in the fetch request to say what type the body is, and what do I include so that the server can parse it? We‚Äôre getting there, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohhh, I hate the new MongoDB stuff! I‚Äôm going to keep going for the reasons stated above, but wow, sold right out! I get it, there‚Äôs money to be made, they could have made the experience better though, like, I have to want to give you money, I don‚Äôt want you to try and trick me into it. Big oof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// About to help out a new developer in Los Angeles with some React stuff. Pretty stoked to be doing anything other than what I‚Äôm doing right now because I really don‚Äôt want to look at Mongo stuff any more right now. I go to the point where my Node app is listening for the client and talking to the Mongo instance and I‚Äôm about to try inserting some documents unless Patrick can please send me the video call link any faster, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// OOOOHHHHKAAAAY I JUST SPENT FOUR AND A HALF HOURS TUTORING SOMEONE, WHOA. GOODNIGHT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And best wishes!

Didn‚Äôt get a job in tech yet! Made it through an interview and didn‚Äôt get laughed off‚Ä¶]]></description><link>https://www.garethfield.com/life-at-the-train-station/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.garethfield.com/life-at-the-train-station/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 11 Apr 2020 11:16:44 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alright, so, didn‚Äôt get the job ‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt get &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; job! Didn‚Äôt get a job in tech &lt;em&gt;yet!&lt;/em&gt; Made it through an interview and didn‚Äôt get laughed off, and now with that matter concluded, as well as the Logoed project, I have a tremendous amount of freedom in this moment! (Language is important! Can‚Äôt change the past, only ourselves in this moment! Allonz-y!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To table something, the apartment people will need to be dealt with here, as they were not exactly either forthcoming or knowledgable about the emergency updates to the grace period as far as rent goes, but I need to act on the highest priority matters right now, and so I shall!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there‚Äôs like three pieces here, what to work on, getting applications out there, and community involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to front, community involvement. Just waded through the Reactiflux Discord, definitely worth being on there, the help sections are invaluable, it‚Äôs good for mental health to be able to chat with folk, and the jobs section is always active. Twitter, too, same, always seeing hot tips, hot takes, and hot jobs there. I‚Äôd love to start a New London JavaScript meetup when things get a little bit back to normal, so that‚Äôs something to plan for. Also, involvement in Open Source is a great way to learn and looks good on the resume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then job applications. I‚Äôve got a few lists/places to look, so I thought what I‚Äôd do would be to put together a list of jobs that I‚Äôd really like, places I‚Äôd really like to work at, all that jazz, and then make a list of jobs I could maybe fit at, places I‚Äôd maybe like to work at, all that jazz, and then make a list of jobs that were definite maybes, so to speak, and then start with the definite maybes, and then by the time I get to the jobs I‚Äôd really like, I‚Äôm a tech-application-filling-outer pro, and I‚Äôll be very likely to actually apply to the whole list that way. I remember when I was a kid and got sugary cereal with marshmellows, I‚Äôd eat all the non-marshmellow bits first so basically I‚Äôd end up with candy at the end. Nutritionally questionable, but a sign of good planning skills and self-motivation from an early age! üòÜ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, what to work on is an interesting question. Totally valid to polish up the Logoed project, but it would be really nice to have a break from that. Then there‚Äôs my website, it‚Äôs definitely starting to be a little painful both updating it because I‚Äôm not sure exactly what‚Äôs changing between builds, and now I know how to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git diff&lt;/code&gt;! Also painful just looking at it, it‚Äôs pretty horrific, lol. There‚Äôs also a few small things I‚Äôd like to do with React Native, one is the splash screen issue in RN60+, and also getting down the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;flex: 1,&lt;/code&gt; vs &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;display: flex;&lt;/code&gt; thing, might go through FlexBox Froggie and throw some penguins in there and build it in React and React Native. Speaking of penguins, there‚Äôs games to be built, that‚Äôs always fun! There‚Äôs also Run Club, kinda no better time to work on that, too! (And the other machine is upgrading to Catalina!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as what I do &lt;em&gt;today,&lt;/em&gt; I think I‚Äôll go back up that list, work on some code for a while, work on applications for a while, and keep thinking about community stuff throughout, staying on Reactiflux and looking out for any open source libraries that need help along the way. Okay go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Splash60Plus, init! I was so annoyed that I (totally my fault) broke the whole app I was working on trying to get that one bit of polish, when like it‚Äôs the first impression, and surely other people are doing this too. To Google! Ooh, or to GitHub!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, this repo is massive, wtf, and this wasn‚Äôt updated after 2018, but resource 1 is (Rohit Sharma‚Äôs epic Documentation Repo)[https://github.com/rohit120582sharma/Documentation/wiki/React-Native-~-Splash-Screen#create‚Äîadd-splash-screen-in-rnn] he says in (another part)[https://github.com/rohit120582sharma/Documentation/wiki/React-Native-~-Application-Architecture] that he‚Äôs using react-native-splash-screen ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt see that he goes into it any more than linking to the library though, and I don‚Äôt know what version of RN he‚Äôs on ‚Ä¶ What a wiki though! Holy moley!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, okay, first hit in the code tab, I don‚Äôt know where in the tree this is, but it‚Äôs an Infinite Red starter (ACR Talk)[https://github.com/jamonholmgren/acr-talk/tree/c9ad09522caa27f8b89e820c8afad041f0eef5f2/AcrReactNative] ‚Ä¶ RN 0.60.5 and react-native-splash-screen 3.1.1 ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Splash60Plus under source control, LOL. Oh, build failed off the bat, lol! Right, on-device testing needs provisioning ‚Ä¶ Signing and Capabilities &gt; Team &gt; TrailCity Inc. (heh ‚Ä¶ ehh ‚Ä¶) ‚Ä¶ Building ‚Ä¶ Building ‚Ä¶ Yay it runs. I need to put myself together and walk Dawa again now before trying Android, because it‚Äôs not showing up in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;adb devices&lt;/code&gt; and I don‚Äôt remember what I did to get this working. It‚Äôs not kill-server, it‚Äôs not turning debugging off and on again. USB driver? Anyway ‚Ä¶ lol, so before I go, I tried another cable, and that worked! ü§£ And I‚Äôm going to assemble job listings while walking Dawa rather than just listening to a podcast or music or whatever! To the future! //&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OOOHHKAY SO: HELLO EXHAUSTION. It‚Äôs still pretty brisk out, and I just walked around the block for multiple hours going through job listings. (Candor.co)[candor.co] is great, but wow ‚Ä¶ so much ‚Ä¶ so cold ‚Ä¶ ow my back and shoulders from holding the phone. Let‚Äôs count ‚Ä¶ because I‚Äôm still in the ‚ÄòA‚Äôs ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, starting with the ShopTalk Show listings, actually, 21 listings, 4 were no longer hiring, 1 I couldn‚Äôt tell, two were for other specialties (backend, data vis,) 5 were for senior roles, 3 had specific requirements in terms of experience/portfolio, 2 were Tier One choices (yay!), 1 was Tier Two, there was a support role, and one started off with ‚ÄúWe have a passion for the Church ‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Ä¶ yea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahhh, there are dozens left still in the ‚ÄòA‚Äôs!!! So this site says either ‚ÄúHiring‚Äù, ‚ÄúNot Hiring‚Äù, ‚ÄúMixed Accounts‚Äù, or ‚ÄúLayoffs‚Äù and updates live, which is awesome, but most of the postings don‚Äôt have links, so Googling every company, trying to find their careers page, going through their job listings, and most of the time it not being a developer position or being for a senior role has been totally exhausting on mobile. Now I‚Äôm back to my computer, this might be a little faster ‚Ä¶ going to try to get through the ‚ÄòA‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ //&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh my gosh, it‚Äôs 5:30, and I got through the ‚ÄòA‚Äôs on that last walk with Dawa. At least I stopped writing down every one where it wasn‚Äôt going to work. If I kept going at that same rate, it‚Äôd take me two weeks just to go through them, so obviously that‚Äôs not right. Also there are other sources, like AngelList, keeping up with Discord and the React subReddit, and there‚Äôs Hiring React Native ‚Ä¶ I think I need to focus on being a full-stack dev with React, React Native, and Node, and see if I can produce some work that‚Äôs a little more polished. Run Club was actually pretty far along before I stopped working on it ‚Ä¶ and I need some sort of process here of continuing with all of this, or I‚Äôm going to lose it. Like procedurally, because what I‚Äôm trying to do is complicated, and mentally, like ‚Ä¶ deep breaths, here. The dog and the cold and the financial stress and the pandemic compounding everything, I‚Äôm a little on edge here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Done with job stuff for now though. Where was I with dev stuff? I should power through, tonight. Android build failed with either a gradle thing, a path thing, or a network thing. Try the build again, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh you know what I just thought of? My sister said sometimes artists need help with websites, I should look for art that has art as the subject, and do some photoshopping, that would be funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶ My dog decided that dinner was acceptable with a little cheese sprinkled on top. Hooray. üêï&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, running &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;droid&lt;/code&gt; again did not fix the problem. Probably rules out network. Let‚Äôs see if Android Studio can do any magic here. Checking path is next. // Wait ‚Ä¶ connect timed out? I‚Äôm two feet from the router, what‚Äôs happening? Okay, I just edited the global gradle properties and comment out the proxt lines as per (stack overflow)[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42516117/android-studio-gradle-sync-failed-connection-timed-out-connect,] and my dog is whining at me. Yeap. Really glad the app built, on our way out, lol. // Aight, well, global WTF WAS THAT?!? ‚Ä¶ That was Camille, dropping Bella‚Äôs leash and freaking out, at the same time as whatever is happening upstairs was happening, so I thought Camille had fallen again or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aight, well, global gradle.properties, comment out the proxy lines. Git commit. git checkout -b acr ‚Ä¶ yarn add react-native-splash-screen ‚Ä¶ todo myself on learning react-native-dotenv ‚Ä¶ oh boy, so I need to todo myself on learning how they do this whole thing. The gist is that they‚Äôre calling setUpRootStore in a useEffect(()=&gt;{stuff},[]) in app.tsx, and stuff sets rootStore as state, and if !rootStore, return null, and they‚Äôre only calling hide on the splash screen in storybook mode. I wonder if it‚Äôs because there‚Äôs a rerender caused by the state changing that negates the need to do so explicitly? Let‚Äôs go with that, for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, wait, it wasn‚Äôt just the react-native-splash-screen readme that got me there last time, it was (this article from Spencer Carli!)[https://medium.com/handlebar-labs/how-to-add-a-splash-screen-to-a-react-native-app-ios-and-android-30a3cec835ae] Okay, now I have two sources at least, one that I can trust that it works because it‚Äôs RN60+ and Infinite Red, and the other because Spencer Carli and I‚Äôd actually followed it before back in 2017 or 2018, but understanding what‚Äôs really going on here needs a clearer head than mine right now, except for food, hygeine, and other essentials, I haven‚Äôt stopped for more than twelve hours, and I‚Äôm like done-zowski here. I wish I could just go and go and go. Maybe when I‚Äôve got everything more dialed in, my ankle is better, Dawa and I can train up midday and the endorphins (todo link to &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; post) are flowing, I‚Äôll be able to crank out 14, 15, 16 hours of really good work in a day. I‚Äôm looking forward to it. For now, my back hurts, I‚Äôm exhausted, Dawa and I are going to get another run in tomorrow, probably another something close to 3 or 4 miles since he hasn‚Äôt been trained enough recently (entirely my fault,) and Lord have mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes,
~g&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. Did I add react-native-splash-screen AFTER checkout -b? silly goose ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

Or just not wanting that knowledge to immediately leak out through my ears. ü§£&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first! I couldn‚Äôt get the new disk drive cable to attach to the bracket, so I tried just plugging it in and leaving it outside of the machine, and it‚Äôs working! I think! It didn‚Äôt recognize the boot USB at first, but I reset the NVRAM and PRAM and it booted right up and started installing MacOS High Sierra! Holy cow! Ordered a new cable plus bracket, pretty cheap, considering I get a whole backup machine, just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Okay, so, an update on my day, I meant to get to work like way sooner, but I worked out, worked the dog out, cooked and did meal prep, got supplies, walked the dog again, and went through a video of stuff I have to deal with that my father sent me, and now it‚Äôs 4pm. Bit of an oof, but I took care of my body and at least some of what I had to do ‚Ä¶ still haven‚Äôt heard from the company I interviewed with and I‚Äôm kinda just wishing the hammer would drop, &lt;strong&gt;but moving on!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1: Working Yourself Super Hard and Sleeping Is Great&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I seriously wish I could wake up with the answers to whatever it was I was working on the previous day spilling out of my head and jump up out of bed (ha) to write it down and be energized every single morning. Freaking amazing when it happens, doesn‚Äôt happen all the time. Moving forwards, first of all I know it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; happen, so the next plan is going to include trying to get it to happen more consistently (by working myself super hard and trying to get &lt;del&gt;good sleep&lt;/del&gt; sleep) while also recognizing that when it doesn‚Äôt happen, having routines, process, and discipline is what gets you through. Say what you will about making coffee first thing in the morning, I believe Michael Pollan wrote about the dangers of this in one of his latest books &lt;a href=&quot;https://michaelpollan.com/books/caffeine-how-coffee-and-tea-created-the-modern-world/&quot;&gt;Caffeine: How coffee and tea created the modern world,&lt;/a&gt; but I get up and I know what my next steps are, generally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lol, on that first day when I woke up and started working on Logoed again, that night, ‚Äúthere are sounds coming from &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt; right now, and I can‚Äôt handle it ‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Ä¶ Yeap. Like two nights ago, almost totally lost it. Please let this all work out so I can escape every night being movie night upstairs, yelling tweaker man, and Camille, bless her heart, with her somewhat endearing and ineffectual, yet loud, alarming and automatic admonition of her dog Bella.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2: Auth, Navigation, and useContext, Oh My!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy moley is the standard screen-to-screen navigation library for React Native (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react-navigation&lt;/code&gt;) better as of v5, and I was able to get a decent user authentication system set up in like less than a day of work, or at least &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; user authentication system set up in less than a day, and worked out some bugs in my reasoning and understanding the next day. So nice! Everything is a component or a hook these days! I had no idea how to use the Context API when I was writing class components, too, coming off of Redux, and I‚Äôm still not sure I quite get it, but I know how to implement basic global state management, including user authentication, and wire it all up, and it‚Äôs a beautiful thing. It used to be that you‚Äôd start a React Native project and then wrestle with these things for &lt;strong&gt;weeks&lt;/strong&gt; and hopefully you‚Äôd get there with it, and not touch it again until you really, really had to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;React Native 60+&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of new hotness, I‚Äôve never added so many dependancies that required linking and had them just &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; before! Auto-linking is a beautiful thing, and developing with React Native has gotten &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much better since it first came out! And yes I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; feel like an old man because I was coding when ReactJS came out, and it‚Äôs been a longer time between now and then compared to that moment and when JQuery came out! ‚Ä¶ and yes I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; pull in the entirety of JQuery for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$.ajax&lt;/code&gt; at one point, lol. It‚Äôs been a long road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The native side will still get you, though. I tried adding &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react-native-splash-screen&lt;/code&gt; to the project, which &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; requires some modification of the native code, and I know I‚Äôd done it before because the old RunClub project had it, and I even got rid of that flash of a white screen that annoyingly accompanied my beautiful splash screen for it, but the basic templates have changed since then, and I totally broke everything. This is when I learned a lesson about keeping my project under source control! Or hopefully I learned it! I certainly learned about &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git diff&lt;/code&gt;, and that I‚Äôve advanced enough that the manual pages for git commands aren‚Äôt totally scary anymore!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Setup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of a couple weeks ago, I didn‚Äôt have Internet at my apartment, and the cable I was using to connect my phone was wonky, and things are better now,, but they &lt;em&gt;sucked.&lt;/em&gt; Can‚Äôt forget that my dude in Lagos hasn‚Äôt even been in contact for a week, and who knows if his country has like, electricity on the regular at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Styled-Components, and Other Elegant Solutions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn‚Äôt actually end up using them, though I was about to run into having enough components reused to start. The one thing that‚Äôs a big &lt;strong&gt;TODO&lt;/strong&gt; is to figure out exactly how the React Native &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;flex&lt;/code&gt; attribute translates to, and can be translated back from, flexbox in CSS, because it‚Äôs a whole thing. Most examples of other people‚Äôs code is in the standard React Native &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;style={{ attribute: &amp;#39;value&amp;#39; }}&lt;/code&gt; format, but if your app gets big enough ‚Ä¶ I mean, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; keep doing that and use components, but I‚Äôm just so used to seeing CSS look like CSS, and being able to take in props in a styled component without having to remember to explicitly consume them ‚Ä¶ I dunno, the mental model just feels nicer to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For about two weeks though, I hardly used styled-components, and was just throwing inline styles at things and seeing if I could get them to look okay. Same with things like state management, where I really only used Context because I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to lift the state up properly, and prop-drilling ad nauseum. Oh and conditional rendering and abstraction, I just didn‚Äôt feel like doing it, if the lines of code I‚Äôd have to write weren‚Äôt going to save me time getting to my goal of sending a demo of the design concepts off to Dave. Maybe if I‚Äôd started earlier with it, the end result would have been more polished ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure. Just something I‚Äôm still learning to keep an eye on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ooo, right, like Formik! If I ever have to build a serious form in React again, totally reaching for it, but for little stuff, a controlled component is just so many less lines of code! Forgot about that one ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Looking Back, The Gist&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, so the big themes are that each of the problems I faced were solved by taking a step back and being able to think clearly, that it‚Äôs a lot of work every day to be doing this thing, that it doesn‚Äôt need to &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like a lot of work if I‚Äôm taking care of myself and am being mindful of really experiencing the process, including all the tangential things like participating in the community, and that I really have come a long way here, and also have a long ways to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm so glad I started writing about this every day! I‚Äôm sorry if anyone is actually reading along, lol, especially two days ago where I realized the description in the frontmatter of the markdown document wasn‚Äôt necessarily displayed in the post, so the first sentence just went massively &lt;em&gt;whoosh,&lt;/em&gt; but just for me, I‚Äôm going to wake up tomorrow and know that I can really do this thing, and it doesn‚Äôt matter in the long run whether that company gires me or not, I‚Äôve got a lot of value I can add to the world and I‚Äôm going to do it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allonz-y! ‚Ä¶ and best wishes, üòÑ
~g&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. &lt;em&gt;Just&lt;/em&gt; helped someone out in the help-react-native channel on Reactiflux with some of the stuff I learned about screens and hooks in the last couple weeks! NICE!!&lt;/p&gt;

Got my second cup of coffee ready here ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs going to be a big day! One way or another!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoping to finish off this Logoed project today, which I‚Äôve been saying for almost a week, lol, but fo‚Äô rizzle. Hoping to hear from the folks who might employ me today! Crazy! Either way, game time! Also, it‚Äôs time for another major clean of the apartment. I mean, it‚Äôs not &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; that bad, I did a major clean ‚Ä¶ what, a week and a half ago? I haven‚Äôt cleaned the bathroom after Dawa‚Äôs haircut though, so there‚Äôs dog hair everywhere, the dishes need doing, the laundry needs doing ‚Ä¶ For the moment, coding is going to happen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hard thing is going to be the x-y problem. The easy thing is going to be styling the pages afterwards ‚Ä¶ I hope, lol. I mean, I also hope the x-y problem is easy ‚Ä¶ ow, I hope my back doesn‚Äôt hurt like this all day, I‚Äôve only been sitting five minutes üòê Oh, and did the image disappear? Oh, no, that was because I switched top and left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;X and Y.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so we‚Äôre running &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;setXY(e, gestureState) =&amp;gt; { setX(x + gestureState.dx / pixelRatio); setY(y + gestureState.dy / pixelRatio); }&lt;/code&gt; and logging x and y with a useEffect hook, and the nice thing is that at least the logo is like, stopping when drag is released, because before what it would do would be to like, keep going for a bit after, like you‚Äôd let it go and it‚Äôd think, nah, I‚Äôd rather be another forty pixels or so in the direction you just moved me in, and jump there. So there‚Äôs that. And setting the initial state of x and y is working, at least for this screen, but the values that are getting logged are ‚Ä¶ not correct ‚Ä¶ I mean, it‚Äôs working, but I don‚Äôt know why. When you take the snapshot, though, the image is placed where the numbers say it should go ‚Ä¶ which ‚Ä¶ is nice ‚Ä¶ but the numbers are like way off ‚Ä¶ yea, so total center of the screen is registering ~70 by ~680 ‚Ä¶ The width and height of the screen are 414 by 896 ‚Ä¶ 212, 448 ‚Ä¶ then the image itself is one third the width of the screen ‚Ä¶ so 138 by 138 ‚Ä¶ but top and left could mean that number should be offset by 69 ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ nice. (Shoot me, lol.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, yes, center is 212 - 69 by 448 - 69. So x is easy. Y ‚Ä¶ how do we get ‚Ä¶ I mean, two thirds, but whyyy?!?! And then, only sort of! EFF! We‚Äôve got to be done here, though, we‚Äôre going to push pixels, and push this project out the damn door, lol. Oh, it‚Äôs started jumping again, too, and the infobox animation is pretty janky again too ‚Ä¶ I wonder if debug being off will help ‚Ä¶ Oh my god, it‚Äôs just going wherever it wants ‚Ä¶ OKAY IF I HOLD IT IN JUST EXACTLY THE MIDDLE, LOL! What a shit-show ‚Ä¶ so it‚Äôs got to be some coefficient of the total dx/dy ‚Ä¶ yes, okay, so ‚Ä¶ the original x and y values minus the current ones, times pixelRatio, minus 69? Oh, it disappeared, oh no, lol ‚Ä¶ nooo, what magic did I do ‚Ä¶ OKAY! CHRIST! subtract y-initial by y, multiply by pixelRatio, subtract THAT from y ‚Ä¶ WHY?! I DON‚ÄôT KNOW, GO ASK DAN ABRAMOV! lol. Fixed it though. Commit ‚Ä¶ wait, let me reinstall the app, run it in non-debug mode, see if it behaves the same, lol. YAAAS!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Everything Else&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the animation was smooth! Woot! And while it‚Äôs totally worth feeling jittery to solve the x-y problem, I need to go for a walk now, lol! Dawa doesn‚Äôt want to walk, it‚Äôs a little chilly and raining, and I kind of want to go for a run, but I don‚Äôt want to mess my back or ankle up right now, so just some juggling and time on my feet! Allons!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Back, and back at it, and Dawa is giving me a bit of a break because it‚Äôs raining ‚Ä¶ fonts is going well ‚Ä¶ viewshot is sometimes not getting the logo, which is a little annoying, so I tried putting it on the outside of the view, but it didn‚Äôt like that, but maybe I just need to delete and reinstall the app? Restart the packager? Sacrafice a lemming? &lt;em&gt;I‚Äôll do it, too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Life gives you lemons, don‚Äôt make lemonade. Make Life take the lemons back! Get mad! I don‚Äôt want your damn lemons, what the hell am I supposed to do with these?! Demand to see Life‚Äôs manager! Make Life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons! Do you know who I am? I‚Äôm the man who‚Äôs going to burn your house down! With the lemons! I‚Äôm going to get my engineers to invent a combustable lemon that burns your house down! ‚Äî J. K. Simmons&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeap, just needed to reinstall the app, lol. Isn‚Äôt this a joy? At least it‚Äôs not Objective-C though. // Oh this is the stupidest thing, why isn‚Äôt the text showing up in the modal? It says it‚Äôs there in the debugger ‚Ä¶ reinstalling ‚Ä¶ Also I just wrote the grossest set of ternaries because I‚Äôve had three cups of coffee and a kombucha today and I cannot be bothered, lol. I just want this finished!! Ahhh!! WHY ISN‚ÄôT THE FUCKING LOGO SHOWING UP?!?!? OR THE FUCKING MODAL TEXT?!?!? Now the logo shows up in the debugger, but only in the caption copy screen, and then still no text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;YAY!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yay, I did it! I‚Äôm uploading the video I recorded demoing it, and I‚Äôm going to send it to Dave, and I‚Äôm going to be done with it! It‚Äôs not as polished as I wanted, of course, and it did the bug thing where it didn‚Äôt record the logo on the second run, but it did on the first run! GOOD ENOUGH!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YES!&lt;/p&gt;

I need to be the big bad wolf here and finish off his haircut, and finish off this Logoed project, at least as much as it‚Äôs going to get finished off, and I feel bad about not being able to give it all the polish it deserves, but it‚Äôs got to be off my plate before tonight, and tomorrow I need to wake up unburdened. Tomorrow I‚Äôm (likely) going to get a call or an email back with a yes or a no as far as moving on with this job, which is very exciting, but I need to be ready to hit the gas, either way. SO! I‚Äôm going to make a todo list and &lt;em&gt;hop to it!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs see, trivial stuff out of the way, I randomly got a life insurance check, when they said they weren‚Äôt going to send one, but maybe the claim and the returned premiums are different? I don‚Äôt know, rent is due tomorrow, and I know they‚Äôre going to work with me on it, because unless the federal tax return comes in I‚Äôm not going to make it, but like everyone is out of a job, damn near, because of this whole pandemic thing. Oof, and there was another bill in two days, but I don‚Äôt remember what. There was something on the 10th and something on the 20th ‚Ä¶ eugh! Nnnope, no federal tax return yet. Weird, usually the state one comes later, but I got it a week ago. This sucks, I barely have food in the house. AHHH, lol!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Umm, what other small things, well, just that since I gave Dawa half of the tab of the medicine at 9, somewhere between 11 and 1 will be the window of opportunity there, and I should set the pomodoro timer going so that I can use my time well in here ‚Ä¶ eh, actually, an hour and a half? That‚Äôs like ‚Ä¶ this should be enough time to just bust it out if I‚Äôm working intelligently ‚Ä¶ so the aspect ratio thing, I‚Äôm not going to worry about that. The pendingDrag and logo size, that‚Äôs got to happen. Restructuring the ‚Äòis this you‚Äô modal slightly, and altering the profile creation text, that‚Äôs going to happen. I really want to get the fonts in there, I don‚Äôt think that should take long. Restructuring the business selection screen, that shouldn‚Äôt take too long, and then for presentational purposes I‚Äôll put together the table tent type thing for Leilu. Okay, the animation could be worse, I might play with the timing a bit, but that‚Äôs pretty okay. Have to get the conditional text in there, and decide what to do about either a timed drop of the modal or just a button plus tap-outside or what. Oop, and I need to put the whole moving on thing back together, that‚Äôs just a minute, and then getting the caption to look right, and the button bigger, but that‚Äôll be the same button as the qr code button, and then some sort of feedback, what are we doing there ‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll cross that bridge when we get to it. And then just the next screen needs a little restructuring and there to be only one button at first, and then when you get back and say you did it, we‚Äôll need the loading screen to pop for a second and to create the thank you page and drawer stuff. Oh boy. Okay maybe more than an hour and a half. Maybe not, let‚Äôs see. Oh, and the loading screen at the front of the app, why isn‚Äôt it displaying anything, that needs to have a conditional message, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs take that from the top, why isn‚Äôt the loading screen displaying properly, lol. // Okay, it &lt;em&gt;is,&lt;/em&gt; but it‚Äôs showing please log in with Auth0 to use the app ‚Ä¶ what is the presentation going to look like? Let‚Äôs make sure we blow away the async storage thing, and delete the user, and what does that look like ‚Ä¶ oh thank you helpful error messages! There‚Äôs a .remove, who‚Äôd‚Äôa thunk. Mmm, so, .removeItem actually, and shoutout to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TatianaTMac/status/1247605419230388224&quot;&gt;@TatianaMac&lt;/a&gt; suggesting defaulting to searching github rather than google, definitely going to do that more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, jeez, my computer is like, heating up, VS Code is stopping working every once and a while ‚Ä¶ lord have mercy ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alrighty, two seconds to read the loading screen seems like enough time, maybe I bump it to two and a half, go crazy with it. // Alrighty, profile creation, is this you modal ‚Ä¶ // Okay, put myself together, have another coffee going, what‚Äôs left on the list?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pendingDrag and logo size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fonts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;businessSelection screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leilu table tent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;play with animation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conditional text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;drop button, use tap-outside for the presentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fix the viewshot flow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instagram post text (plus image?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ShareIt page (plus image?) plus flow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thank you page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dog time though, go go go! I think it‚Äôs allergies time, too! //&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, &lt;strong&gt;no!&lt;/strong&gt; I just got the news that Bernie isn‚Äôt running anymore. We‚Äôre &lt;em&gt;fucked!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that I got Dawa‚Äôs haircut like 95% done, and that‚Äôs despite me finding the pill he somehow tricked me into thinking he swallowed on the floor, but honestly, I‚Äôm &lt;em&gt;rocked.&lt;/em&gt; There was this thread of hope that maybe the government could be nudged back in the right direction, but America is a rolling stone going down, as far as I can tell, now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appropriate response would be to lean into it, work harder than ever, get personally involved in local politics in some way, journalism or organizing or running for something, I don‚Äôt know, but honestly the temptation to go buy way too much beer and anaesthatize myself is definitely there. Just when I was doing so well with that, too, lol. No, I‚Äôm not going to do that. I mean, not yet, at least. I‚Äôm going to get some snacks (that were supposed to be for later, but I need a mood boost &lt;em&gt;now,&lt;/em&gt;) make some tea, and code. Then I‚Äôm going to get a little mad, because in my head I was thinking, the code doesn‚Äôt care that this is going to hurt a lot of people, but I remembered, what I do with code could make &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the difference, and that being a force multiplier is what it‚Äôs all &lt;em&gt;about,&lt;/em&gt; and what am I doing with my time and my talents?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, deep breath, sit up, hit build in Xcode, and make some tea ‚Ä¶ which is about how long building this thing in Xcode takes my computer, lol ‚Ä¶ Ahh, everything is running slow, por que?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Okay, fixing screens, rockin on, time to get the Logoing screen fixed. First, the shutter and logo shouldn‚Äôt be visible until the modal drops ‚Ä¶ no, that‚Äôs fine, speed up the entrance though ‚Ä¶ oh yea! Nice. Now the Leilu logo is invisible as is, time to fix the scale and maybe add a border or background or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Mmm, been at it a while and my brain is starting to numb out ‚Ä¶ I think I got the ternaries in the right place, but setting up the state management for them and whether a snapshot being taken should also saveSnapShot and navigate out is something for when I come back to the computer. Looking good though! Just these last few details of the Logoing screen, then the post-Logoing flow, and maybe putting fonts in, then make the presentation, then ‚Ä¶ try not to think about the news too much, lol!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Okay, had a bit of a bike ride, back, added an icon for profile creation, tapping a list item submits it, decided I‚Äôm only going to show drag and then snap, not snap and then drag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Dog walk number six, complete. My back started hurting as &lt;em&gt;soon&lt;/em&gt; as I sat down. Nice. The y value is being set to ridiculously high values now, and I have no idea why. My dog is like, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; trying to walk with me now, either, and he‚Äôs totally throwing my back out yanking me all over the place. OW!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Maybe tomorrow :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes,

Up early enough that the dog isn‚Äôt asking to be taken out yet, good sign.

Up early enough that the dog isn‚Äôt asking to be taken out yet, good sign. Whoop, speak of the devil :) //&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so, I‚Äôm going to prioritize my tasks and then start the pomodoro timer off, after looking at the code for the pomodoro timer for a moment, because the pair programming exercise, if I get there, (please let me get there!) is going to be in Node, so let‚Äôs look at some Node code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Node code, bro, whoa! // Oh no, it‚Äôs almost unreadable, lol. Hold on ‚Ä¶ Oh, that‚Äôs nicer. DRY‚Äôed it up a bit, removed a silly dependency, much more readable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so, Logoed tasks, one by one ‚Ä¶ the splash screen, I‚Äôm going to spin up a test project for that, I still want to get it, but since it might be like a lot of trouble, other things for now. Let‚Äôs get some wins. I don‚Äôt know how I broke the viewshot code, so that‚Äôs high priority, and then the infobox, and then everything else, go! Oh, you know what, the whole aspect ratio thing ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs number three maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lol the viewshot code fixed itself. Wtf, lol. Sometimes you just have to wtf. Like this morning, when I woke up, and right then tweaker-man went by ranting about something-or-other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Eugh, some GI upset, and I feel like an &lt;em&gt;idiot&lt;/em&gt; right now, too. I know I slept Sunday night, but Saturday night and last night, not so much, and I am &lt;em&gt;feelin‚Äô it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I didn‚Äôt pass onPress through. I thought I broke everything, lol, but I just took a component out to try and make things more readable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Okay, so just spend like an hour wrestling with react-native-modal and the Animated API, and ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, I can stick with it, and just run the whole animation after the modal has loaded, because the whole ‚Äòtap outside‚Äô thing is no-hassle ‚Ä¶ yea, maybe I‚Äôll do that, either that or just have a seperate modal overlay that‚Äôs always rendered but opaque and tie that to the same animation, but then have to wire up some sort of closing thing ‚Ä¶ still don‚Äôt have an icon that it‚Äôs supposed to disappear into ‚Ä¶ this is surely like, not how to do it, ideally ‚Ä¶ kinda want to reach for a library, but I‚Äôll just press on here and try and make good enough with what I‚Äôve got right now. Dog walking time! üêï&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Bueno! Let‚Äôs see if I can‚Äôt do this thing with react-native-modal ‚Ä¶ okay so I need to set the initial position to way off screen, like all the way to the right and then all the way down plus another screen‚Äôs length (height,) and then so when the modal is &lt;em&gt;going&lt;/em&gt; to animate, fade out the icon, then when the modal &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; animated, zoom and fade the infobox in, then when the modal is &lt;em&gt;going&lt;/em&gt; to animate, zoom and fade the infobox out, and then when the modal &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; animated, fade the icon in. Okay, go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lol I was going to make a coffee at one, but I just forgot and kept working. Pomodoro app doesn‚Äôt do much if I don‚Äôt pay attention, lol. Getting in that zone though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AYY!! Got my first infinite loop error in React Native! Fabulous! It all sorta came together in my mind, and then ‚Ä¶ it didn‚Äôt work, lol. That‚Äôs fine, though, I get to find out why and figure out another way to try it! Or at least find another way to try it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, okay, so actually I was loading the modal in the background when camera permission was set, and the button in the modal had onPress={functionThatAffectedState()} rather than onPress={() =&gt; functionThatAffectedState()} so it was running immediately and causing a rerender loop. Fascinating!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Sweet, okay, requisitioned some supplies, changed marginBottom to marginTop and the animation makes way more sense now, though it‚Äôs hardly perfect, walked the dog for the fifth time today, his food is warming up, and I‚Äôm &lt;em&gt;exhausted&lt;/em&gt; and am going to just pick off some low hanging fruit so that tomorrow I can tackle hopefully the last of the hard stuff tomorrow and that it‚Äôll feel closer to complete will drive me to finish up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so, big phone call today, or Google Hangouts session ‚Ä¶ in the hangout, going to try to match the verbiage ‚Ä¶ anyway, could be a big day, though the way I see it, there‚Äôs a very small chance that I actually get this job, a decent chance I get flat-out rejected, and a pretty good chance I get some sort of a nebulous answer of either maybe a second interview or a we‚Äôll call you back, maybe, so I‚Äôve got my resume, I know a few places where there are some job listings, and I‚Äôm going to get done with the Logoed thing and move on to this site and Run Club so that the resume will even be accurate, lol, because it says I‚Äôm working on those two currently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; do is take the Pluralsight courses on Git and learn it properly, then dive back in, but what I‚Äôm &lt;em&gt;going&lt;/em&gt; to do is make a commit with everything broken, now, look up how to go back and forth between commits properly, make a new branch ‚Äòfix-it‚Äô, and hop back and forth and do my best to get everything working &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; so I can a) bring my confidence back up before this &lt;del&gt;meeting&lt;/del&gt; hangout, and b) move on with my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, &lt;strong&gt;Thursday&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Ä¶ oof. Where are the sticky notes ‚Ä¶ there, I‚Äôve done it, first sticky note on the monitor since moving, ‚ÄúCommit early, commit often!‚Äù Will I learn? Who knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, wow, though, the top answer on StackOverflow just described checkout, diff, and merge so clearly though ‚Ä¶ How haven‚Äôt I seen that before? Or maybe I have, but now I‚Äôve done enough to know what they‚Äôre saying ‚Ä¶ hmm ‚Ä¶ 83ff97fe22640fb4db97cff1c442626ce4708256 is Thursday‚Äôs commit (‚Äòit went boop!‚Äô) and b973cc9d65455256bd669a79bd0e0dc0815809cf is today‚Äôs commit (‚ÄòI broke everything‚Äô) ‚Ä¶ whoa ‚Ä¶ okay, so, yea, just read through git diff ‚Äîhelp ‚Ä¶ what was much less scary than last time I remember reading any git man pages. Okay, so git diff commit1 commit2 === git diff commit1..commit2, you can use ‚Äîname-only or ‚Äîname-status to get just the file names/names plus statuses, and you can tack on either a file or directory and it will either do the file or any files in the directory. Cool! Or git diff HEAD^ HEAD for the version before the last commit and the last commit, which is what I want ‚Ä¶ okay, so I think package.json, then /ios, /android, and /src ‚Ä¶ ooh, I added cameraroll ‚Ä¶ do I even use that yet? Yes! That saves it to the cameraroll, I was thinking the imagepicker. Oh, cool, I can just do git checkout HEAD^ ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, it‚Äôs a start, adding @react-native-community/cameraroll, deleted a .xcodeproj/ that randomly showed up, so (cd ios &amp;#x26;&amp;#x26; pod install) works again ‚Ä¶ waiting, lol ‚Ä¶ did I update the permissions in info.plist yet? I needed to change that, anyway ‚Ä¶ oh, I can‚Äôt checkout another branch while that‚Äôs running, lol ‚Ä¶ No updates, oh this is &lt;em&gt;cool!&lt;/em&gt; // Oh, that took &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; less time than I thought it was going to! That took like an hour and fifteen minutes, all told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweet! It built! And it‚Äôs still buggy, but it‚Äôs not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; type of buggy! Dog-walking time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// AAHHHH!!! Interview! Interview went well! Okay at least! I lived through it! Omg! First off, they‚Äôre super-legit, like no kidding, wow. That I was in way over my head became apparent (hopefully more-so to me, lol! ‚Ä¶ maybe not though, also lol) &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; quickly when he started talking about who was in on the project, both personel and company-wise. Wow though! And so I introduced myself, and I think I forgot to give like any color at all ‚Ä¶ well, that‚Äôs not true, I mentioned how the unpaid internship at Moodbit was like ‚Ä¶ wake up at 3:30, walk the dog, bike to Starbucks and open up at 4:30, work till 12, then bike to the train station, take the train into the city, code till like 6, rinse, repeat, and how the Logoed project ended :(, and that I liked orchids, which apparently the non-technical founder does too ‚Ä¶ but so the coding challenge part, I was like, sooo nervous, omg! He was so nice though, especially because you could tell he was like, trying to get through it and waiting until I stopped talking for a little before nudging me in the right direction ‚Ä¶ that was the wooorst though, omg! I didn‚Äôt remember the do-while syntax, so I used a good ole for loop ‚Ä¶ ahhhh, so not functional! And then I forgot to call the function I wrote, that was soo embarassing, and I called i++ within it, omg ‚Ä¶ nightmare material ‚Ä¶ at least I started it off with a little joke though, the challenge was to print to the console the next thirty leap years, and at least I remembered how to use the modulus operator, and at least I got there, &lt;em&gt;eventually&lt;/em&gt; lol, but so I started by typing out console.log(2020); console.log(2024); console.log(2028); and was like, probably not like that, right? Which I hope he found amusing :) Then I was able to ask him some questions and it was like, BOOM! Guess where‚Äôd this come from, who‚Äôs interested, who‚Äôs working here, and I was like oh, jeez, well, nice interviewing with you, &lt;em&gt;but not out loud&lt;/em&gt; lol, and so I‚Äôll hear back either tomorrow or Thursday! AAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes!!!

Also my sister sent me pictures of her husband and their kids on ‚Ä¶ well, battery powered unicorns and horses? With the sticks, you know what I‚Äôm talking about, you hop about as if you‚Äôre riding horses, it‚Äôs a good time. &lt;strong&gt;HENCE,&lt;/strong&gt; it‚Äôs a mental health neigh. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was pretty seriously depressed this morning. Most of the time, at least in recent memory, I‚Äôve been more-or-less able to keep it together. This morning started off not great though. So I thought of the things I wanted to get done, and then I decided to get the things done that really mattered, and that meant getting up, making a nice cup of coffee on the French press, getting the couple of dishes done, walking Dawa, eating a breakfast salad, writing a letter to my niece, getting a workout in (day three of #coronalMassEjection!) and giving Dawa an anti-anxiety pill, which meant after the workout I was able to put myself together, have some granola and soy milk, and spend the next like three hours cutting Dawa‚Äôs hair and trying to get his nails done. It is a &lt;em&gt;process.&lt;/em&gt; Like, it‚Äôs a haircut where you‚Äôve got to stop and get some lunch and another coffee in the middle. Lunch was beans and rice, and the coffee was eighty grams a grande on the French press by the Hoffman technique, but ground for French press rather than metal, because I didn‚Äôt want to bother with another round of decanting the silt out this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sooo, I find myself unable to bring myself to finish the last ten percent of Dawa‚Äôs haircut (much like the last ten percent of the coding project I should be working on, says a part of my brain,) and with excellent nutrition and a lot of caffeine in me, and I decide to find a trail. I‚Äôd been mulling it over, but I was talking with the nice lady with the two little dogs, Lola and Pepper, down at the dog park, and getting just a little bit of socialization (from a distance!) in, and asking about the bridge to Groton, where I‚Äôd seen on a map that there were some trails within a reasonable distance, and she said there was a pedestrian-slash-bike path, well that did it, it‚Äôs Sunday, I‚Äôd find the trail and next weekend, if I‚Äôd done well this coming week, I‚Äôd have something to look forward to doing, so I packed some water, glanced at the map for general directions, and headed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skip ahead to the nice officer informing me, halfway across, that you can‚Äôt just bike across the bridge (I95,) and me responding yes, thank you, this doesn‚Äôt look anything like the bike path, him asking me whether I was from New London, me saying I‚Äôd just moved here and had heard that there was, him rolling his eyes and proceeding to explain in depth how there was a pedestrian-slash-bike path on the north side of the bridge, though notably without good directions to or instructions on how to find the entrances to this path beyond ‚Äòask someone,‚Äô but there we have it, and he was nice enough to escort me across the rest of the bridge with his lights on, rolling along in the shoulder behind me at a good twenty, twenty-five miles an hour, and I waved as I exited and chalked it up to another biking on a bridge adventure, and ask me about the others in person and not in writing if you don‚Äôt mind, but so eventually I got to Groton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And oohhh, Nelly are there some nice trails a couple miles in, there!! It‚Äôs not like, expansive, as far as trail networks go, but that‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;the stuff!&lt;/em&gt; Single-track, rocks, roots, roller-coaster little hills, brooks to jump over, occasional mountain bikers to overtake, and some real &lt;em&gt;nature!&lt;/em&gt; I just don‚Äôt feel myself when I can‚Äôt feel like a ‚Ä¶ oh, that word has some negative connotations ‚Ä¶ savage is only sort of what I mean, and invoking ‚Äòlike an animal‚Äô doesn‚Äôt really improve matters ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs so important to me, but I lack the vocabulary to talk about it in a way that invokes the feeling of really being a part of the natural world around oneself in a non-problematic way, and to at once say that it‚Äôs indicative &lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt; a problem in society today, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; to segue with something possibly equally problematic, forty-five minutes later found me screaming like a little girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôd forgotten that I was afraid of heights, and, when I finally used Google Maps to navigate me to the pedestrian-slash-bike path (which was &lt;em&gt;hardly&lt;/em&gt; marked at all, and also Google took me down absolutely-not-a-bike-path to get there at one point!) I found myself on a pathway that varied from three to sometimes two feet wide with a several hundred foot drop on the side that wasn‚Äôt Jersey barrier, and the seperation between you and that was a series of thin vertical iron bars, with nothing horizontal happening anywhere between the very bottom and ten feet up. Think of the last time you went by some barrier that consisted of just vertical slits, and how they tend to just visually disappear. Basically the experience was of careening along a narrow path, at speed, with certain death looming and drawing you in, as the abyss tends to, on one side. Whoever designed this was an @$$hole. I think the one gentleman also using the path correctly read my genuine terror and chuckled a bit at or with me. After clenching my handlebars and the seat with my hands and thighs, screaming, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be here!‚Äù ‚ÄúWho would do such a thing! (Designing it this way)‚Äù and good ole‚Äô, ‚ÄúAAAHHHHHAHAHAHAAAHAAAAA!!!!!‚Äù I exited, marked where the entrance was, and, swearing I‚Äôd never go back, marked the spot in my memory for the next time I‚Äôll go to the trail across the bridge in Groton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to finish putting the chicken I‚Äôve just made down for Dawa, posting this, and winding down for the night, and tomorrow I‚Äôve got a very important phone call, could stand to finish up the rest of Dawa‚Äôs haircut, and could probably stand to enjoy some of the sixty degrees and sunshine with him, poor little guy, and we‚Äôll figure out the coding thing and the financial thing and the computer part thing (anyone own an extremely small pair of needlenose pliers?) with a head that‚Äôs ready to reason things through calmly and rationally, in a more grounded manner, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, best wishes!

Quarantine getting in the way of getting fit and lean? Self isolation getting in the way of self care? Coronavirus have you going up a couple sizes? Being good about washing your hands but finding it hard to fit into your pants? #coronalMassEjection. This is day two for me, since a few days ago I tried going for a run and my Achilles acted up 4.2 miles in because I haven‚Äôt really been training and have put on like ten pounds, so yesterday I worked out in my apartment, and today I went for a nice long bike ride ‚Ä¶ and &lt;em&gt;then,&lt;/em&gt; oh boy, got the laundry done, dishes done, bathroom cleaned, sofa de-dusted, vacuuming done, dog walked well, recycling out, and I ate spinach for breakfast, some granola and soy milk to recover for the ride, and then rice and beans for lunch ‚Ä¶ but have I done any coding yet today, when I meant to have the Logoed thing finished up this morning? Nope, lol. But I‚Äôve got food in me, a coffee here, and a clean apartment, which really helps me think clearly. When I‚Äôm inspired, I can galaxy-brain right through total chaos, but these days so often I have to like ‚Ä¶ &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; to use my brain, lol. So here goes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I should look through how the app is right now and get the goals to get it to good enough, as well as throw in some nice-to-haves and definitely-todos, and then I can have the list in order to get this version done enough to show off the design-y bits to Dave, and then some stuff to work on to get the thing more polished for a portfolio piece, and then like the major todos for if Dave actually wants me back on the project, or to give to the devs on the project now along with the code, whatever, you know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, deep breaths, some coffee, time to look at what I built with a critical eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loading. Splash screen is an ugly color with ugly text, it‚Äôs not on brand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No time to read the instructions to please log in with Auth0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No Logoed logo in universal signup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Header title too small, no fonts loaded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profile Creation and Just your Instagram handle should just be one thing, no need for a title (see later, maybe a title would be good,) and a please would go a long way. YourAwesomeInsta! is stupid. A blank avatar picture would help people get the idea quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You know, if it was half-price apps, there‚Äôd be no reason to spam, like you could just use another email and instagram account to spam for raffle tickets if you were so inclined, unless we built in anomaly detection for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The text input is too long, and not tall enough. The gray for the placeholder and disabled button should be the same. I wonder what dark orange on the header would look like, or a linear gradient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the whole thing was up higher, you could have just some texture down on the bottom to make it look better, and then it wouldn‚Äôt seem like it was jumping so much to avoid the keyboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It needs to remove trailing spaces, there shouldn‚Äôt be any trailing spaces. Can you have Instagram handles with spaces in them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The text input outline and button color should be the same blue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The spinner should be even bigger, and spin longer to simulate the network request properly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The handle and the picture should be connected, then the prompt, then the buttons, and the buttons should be differentiated, maybe side-by-side, one blue one red or gray.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is where using the header title seems like good standard practice to follow, though again the font and font size and weight, and background color.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The prompt needs rewriting and seperating, heirarchically and by font size, maybe a seperator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sub-prompt needs to be more concise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The text input is too wide and not tall enough, and the whole list item needs to be a tap target. Tapping outside the keyboard needs to close it. Return should submit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The list needs to be recognizable as such. Maybe a border, maybe subtle backgrounds for the businesses, maybe seperators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The button for the list select needs to be again, the same color, and disabled when there‚Äôs nothing there. Also maybe in-line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The scan qr code button needs to be seperated from the list, and an icon would go a long way, along with an actual button-looking-button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How about your Insta profile pic at the top left? Opening the drawer? ‚Ä¶ nooo ‚Ä¶&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The logo shouldn‚Äôt render until the camera has access permission. Don‚Äôt distract.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The logo isn‚Äôt denoted as draggable. I think if it was put where the cameraroll box usually is, and if you could animate a glowing backlight for it either when the snapshot is taken, or the info-box icon is tapped, and make it small until it‚Äôs dragged onto the canvas. Also, it should snap into bounds. Also, it should stop moving when you let go! Also it should be in the same place it was in when you take the snapshot!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The shutter is crammed against the bottom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The info-box hasn‚Äôt been built yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The aspect ratio for my phone‚Äôs camera means that it‚Äôs going to get cropped to get posted. Maybe just have there be opaque bars indicating what part of the camera is going to be used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The message for accessing the photos is wrong, it should be so you can save your image and post it to Instagram.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Logoed image should be in the caption copy screen. The only action taken on this screen should be to copy the caption, but hammer it in: THIS PHOTO, THIS CAPTION, ENTER RAFFLE THIS WAY.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don‚Äôt say please, start with the verb. Polite time was earlier, they need to do the thing now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Header title, ‚ÄúCopy Caption‚Äù. Back button doesn‚Äôt need to be enabled, swiping is enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The caption should look like an Instagram caption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I know we‚Äôve had instructions on top, previously, so look this back over, but I imaging having the image, then the caption, then a big button, then the instructions would be best here, so the big button is closer to the center of the screen. Also, it needs feedback to show that an action was taken by hitting the button, not just navigating to the next screen. Like, scale, color change, tooltip, whole nine yards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No back button on the share screen. Get a visual gist, copy the caption, get the visual gist again, get the verbal instruction, off to Instagram. Header title, ‚ÄúShare to Instagram‚Äù.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No two buttons! We‚Äôre trying to move &lt;em&gt;away&lt;/em&gt; from it being cluttered. Same setup as before, gist of the post, big button, instructions. Maybe set state when you hit the botton to go to Instagram that another button shows up, and that takes you to the app drawer, and gives another opportunity for them to see the instructions, in case their drunk asses navigated away and then were like, ‚Äòwhaaat?‚Äô&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where‚Äôs the thank you screen, hamburger menu, all that jazz, buddy? Got some work to do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, when I start being snarky at myself, I‚Äôve spent long enough in critique mode. Some of these things are like, actually majorly hard, like the flipping draggable element, why isn‚Äôt it working, good lord, then there‚Äôs some stuff that‚Äôs legit hard but I could probably do, like the maximum aspect ratio for Instagram posts and the viewport bars, then there‚Äôs some hard stuff I think I can do, like the info-box thing, though getting it &lt;em&gt;nice&lt;/em&gt; could be tricky, and then there‚Äôs a whole lot of easy-to-medium difficulty stuff that I can pick off as I go, oh, and I forgot everything around handling the error states ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a big maybe there. Okay, anyway, there‚Äôs the set of things to do, at least on the front-end, and then there‚Äôs describing why it‚Äôs better than before, and then there‚Äôs describing what would happen on the back-end ‚Ä¶ except the video should go like, Hi, hope y‚Äôall are well, when I left off, there were some problems with the design, and I had thought the web app was the way to go, I thought of some solutions for the design and built it into a native app, which I‚Äôll show to you now, but first, I made this from like scratch in a week and learned the latest version of the screen-to-screen navigation system and this whole other pretty big structural change to the framework along the way, so thank you for the opportunity, but if there are some rough edges, please try and stay focused on the changes in design to make things easier for the user and for us to keep track of things, and secondly, there are two places where I make it seem like the app is talking to our server and doing things, but that‚Äôs hard-coded in just to illustrate the user experience. I‚Äôll talk about those along the way, let‚Äôs get started though. Okay, first, they‚Äôve got to download the app, and the qr code should send them to the app store or google play store if everything is set up properly, or they can go to them and search for Logoed, either way, that‚Äôs a little hurdle, but after upgrading my phone and seeing apps download faster, I‚Äôm not convinced it‚Äôs as big of one. Moving on, I‚Äôm using the service Auth0 to sign the user in or up here, and it keeps an access token in memory for a day so they‚Äôre logged back in if they open the app back up, and that‚Äôs the first identifier for the user. (Moving on.) Second, we should get their Instagram handle, and then we‚Äôve got everything we need to keep track of who‚Äôs who and what‚Äôs happening, and if we have multiple email addresses trying to be one Instagram account or an email address trying to be an Instragram account that‚Äôs taken, that can be handled. Now this little verification step is the first place where our back-end would have to do something, namely get their input and go to instagram.com/whatever-they-typed-in, check if it‚Äôs an actual profile page, and if it is, look for this little bit of information, the url for their profile picture, which it‚Äôs not actually doing right here, I just found the url for mine and threw it in there. This should allow the user to quickly recognize they did it right and hopefully enforce the whole gist of what‚Äôs happening here. Okay, moving on to the business select, and so if they‚Äôre hitting the app through the qr code and have already downloaded the app and have signed in and have put their Instagram handle in, it should be able to automatically skip this part, and if you hit the scan the qr code button, it‚Äôll go through without having to even leave the app, or if they want to search with a text input or scroll down a list, there‚Äôs that. This part is going to need to evolve based on the number of businesses signed up for Logoed, because you don‚Äôt want a list with a thousand businesses on it, you‚Äôll want to narrow it down by location, or however that‚Äôs figured out. For the moment they can live next to eachother here, and both will get you to the next screen with the right logo. Moving on, so this little pop-up is one of the major improvements, because there were like four different things going on in the Logoing screen before, we had the shutter which never went away, a cameraroll box, the logo, and instructions that never went away, and now there‚Äôs the shutter, which goes away, and the logo, and the instructions kind of go away too into that little icon, which if we tap again ‚Ä¶ will bring them up in case the user needs them, but they‚Äôre more or less out of the way. You‚Äôll probably notice dragging the logo and where it‚Äôs placed when you take the snapshot are a little off, but that‚Äôs like probably several days of work to figure out a solution for, or a lucky guess, I don‚Äôt know, I tried a few things but just wanted to get the general idea of how the flow of things could be communicated. Anyway, the next screen has just the one action, copy the caption, which we‚Äôll remember is how we can search for posts, because you can search for as many @mentions as a business on their platform as you want, but a limited number of hashtags per week or whatever, and then once you have the id of that post, you‚Äôre golden and can see if it‚Äôs actually of food and the logo hasn‚Äôt been taken out or whatever. So, yea, this screen, you‚Äôve got the image and the caption together, they should be getting the gist, and they hit the copy caption button and it tells them like, an action has been taken, something happened, caption copied to clipboard, good job, then moving on, and again, one action on this screen, you‚Äôve got the image and the caption, big button, clear concise instructions, hopefully they get the idea, and it‚Äôs off to Instagram. Posting ‚Ä¶ bing ‚Ä¶ bang ‚Ä¶ boom ‚Ä¶ Okay, now back to the app, here we‚Äôve got a big button to confirm that they did it, or they somehow forgot what they were doing and need to go back, and here‚Äôs the second piece where it looks like the back-end is confirming that the image and caption were posted properly, but I‚Äôm just hard-coding it in to illustrate what should happen, okay and so here‚Äôs where they land, and we can thank them and let them know they‚Äôve entered the raffle at Waffle House or wherever they are, and here they can find anything else they might need to find and we might need to include, like a feedback form, a place to list other businesses you can use Logoed at, the status of their raffle entry or maybe qr codes for half-priced appetizers, whatever their reward is, terms of service, all that jazz. Okay, so that‚Äôs the gist, hopefully your team can use this, or not, anyway it‚Äôs been nice working on this, stay well and best wishes, peace!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh boy, okay, so let‚Äôs see if the spash screen works ‚Ä¶ I just made the one asset for my phone and only did like half of the Android setup because MainActivity changed ‚Ä¶ oh, shoot, build failed ‚Ä¶ ahhh ‚Ä¶ anything that Xcode touches, or having to delve into any of that part of things, what a nightmare. EUGH, I have 120 errors, but none of them are from react-native-splash-screen! And they‚Äôre all yellow warnings, not red errors, at least there you know what‚Äôs what ‚Ä¶ :( Okay, cleaning the build folder gave me more errors, upgrading the build target gave me less ‚Ä¶ now I‚Äôm at 124 ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now my .xcodeworkspace is pointing to an assets folder because I don‚Äôt really know how to use Xcode, and I don‚Äôt know when the last commit was, and I‚Äôm going to throw my hands in the air as far as this is concerned, fo‚Äôrizzle, until tomorrow morning when we sticky-note ‚ÄúCOMMIT EARLY, COMMIT OFTEN‚Äù to my monitor, nuke the project, and rebuild from scratch! Holey moley! Maybe I‚Äôll try booting the other machine up now I have the hard drive cable, and maybe there will be &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; new and good going on. Oooof!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell me why I have toothpicks in a clamp and a seperate pair of needlenose pliers trying to make a smaller pair of needlenose pliers though. Done, good night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes,

Meant to be up at five, but resident tweaker-man wandered by barking swearwords at a quarter to, so up we got! Today it was, s#!% man, f%*@#ing stupid-@&amp;#x26;&amp;#x26; lawers ‚Ä¶ eep, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had some dishes to do anyway. Nothing like cleaning when you‚Äôre angry. Take it out on the dirt, not your neighbors :) Made a delicious cup of coffee, too. Got the French presses clean and opened a fresh bag of a Costa Rican/Latin American blend, and brewed fifty-five grams using the Hoffman method, and it came out &lt;em&gt;perfectly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to coding, I‚Äôm going to recap a bit, because I‚Äôve already been at it for like forty-five minutes here, I figured out the react-native-draggable thing! So, I‚Äôve got to keep the x and y values of the draggable element in state, because ‚Ä¶ hmm, well now that I‚Äôm making the images full-screen ‚Ä¶ well, before I was making the images square because we thought we could send them right over to Instagram like that, now I don‚Äôt know if I need to keep x and y in state for getting the composite image of the photo and logo ‚Ä¶ and it might maintain position between navigation, too, I just really don‚Äôt know, anyway, at the moment I‚Äôm using the onDragRelease event and running setXY({ e, gestureState }), but just saying setX(x + Math.round(gestureState.dx)) and setY the same way was sending the element off into the woods, and moveX/moveY just turned out to be the absolute values, and then I looked up ReactNative.PixelRatio, tried getPixelSizeForLayoutSize, which set it off to the moon, and then I looked down at the actual API and there‚Äôs a .get(), so the solution ended up being just const pixelRatio = PixelRatio.get(); setX(x + gestureState.dx / pixelRatio), and I &lt;em&gt;keep&lt;/em&gt; typing pixelRation, lol ‚Ä¶ anyway, it‚Äôs a little wonky, but it seems to work better than anything else ‚Ä¶ except possibly just not managing it, but I haven‚Äôt quite got to the snapshot part yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, the camera is definitely working, and the shutter is definitely doing the thing, but then the image isn‚Äôt displaying, and also it takes like, more than a second for it to figure itself out, so something is amiss there. Also, I can only get the shutter to render by putting text in it, which is annoying. I‚Äôll probably tackle that first, it‚Äôs not the most important, but like, come on. Render a circle. Render it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶ That was easy. Empty &amp;#x3C;View /&gt;. Bada-bing. Now where‚Äôs this image going?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lol, episode three hundred and forty-three of Gareth Is A Silly Goose, I was setting width and height props, it‚Äôs style={{ width: width, height: height }} ‚Ä¶ oh, that‚Äôs a beautiful thing, look at that! Woot! Next up, why isn‚Äôt the draggable element the restaurant logo? Oh, jeez, and I keep on blinding myself by switching over to the browser in light mode ‚Ä¶ ahhh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ayy, there it is! ‚Ä¶ Why did that work? Undefined ‚Ä¶ hmm ‚Ä¶ yaaay it worked! First off, business was the route param, &lt;em&gt;restaurant&lt;/em&gt; was the object with the logo, and I just needed to tack on a [0] to the filter!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lol, CameraRoll has been removed from React Native and now we‚Äôre using @react-native-community/cameraroll ‚Ä¶ take your eye off it for a second and it changes, good ole React Native :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweet, okay, CameraRoll working, ViewShot working, I just need the Draggable in there ‚Ä¶ or to render in another Image at that x and y ‚Ä¶ is that why we needed to keep track of the x and y? I‚Äôm not super certain I ever got this right the last time I made this in React Native, actually, I think that was one of the reasons I went with the PWA, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, now do I need to set position: relative on the parent &amp;#x3C;View&gt;? Nope! Working! Oh ‚Ä¶ so close ‚Ä¶ The image is showing up like a little up and to the right of the draggable element. I wonder if moving draggy-doo inside the viewshot view will do it to it. Starting to lose it a little here, might be time to walk Dawa. Okay, SWEET, could do it with the draggable element, conditionally rendering it along side the camera, all that jazz, just it‚Äôs still like ten pixels up and to the right, and I have no idea why, but it‚Äôs saving it to the camera roll, and I‚Äôm going to map out the states of this screen next and do the whole infobox thing that was like, the main thing I was doing all of this to show off, lol. Lot of learning though! // Okay, well, dog walked, and I think I‚Äôve got to get a workout in or my body is going to rebel ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Alright, dope, got a workout in, put myself together, tried to walk the dog ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶ and got my own walk in to get some snacks and think through the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, I‚Äôm going to finish up the Logoing screen and just fudge the ten pixels thing, maybe try and fix the slight jank of the draggable component, get the info box thing going, get the next few screens written, hard-code the profile creation image, and then I‚Äôm going to make a video about what‚Äôs changed, why it‚Äôs better, how the flow goes, where the server side needs to do its magic, and then hopefully Dave‚Äôs people can take it and run with it, if he‚Äôs paying them and they know good sense when they see it. Who knows. Hopefully then I‚Äôll never have to add a logo to anything ever again though. I‚Äôm only going to put as much polish on it as I can get to by the end of the day today, though, because I need to be working on something else now. Maybe Run Club. Who knows. Or if Dave wants to pay me, fabulous, back to freelancing. Ready, set, go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Well ‚Ä¶ that &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; going well ‚Ä¶ why isn‚Äôt the silly logo staying in place for takeSnapShot?! Ahhh, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Whoa, okay, lost myself in it for a while. At this point I‚Äôm starting to lose it a little, and I think I should probably push finishing up to tomorrow morning ‚Ä¶ which made me look back at the code I was working on, and I think I know why that wasn‚Äôt rendering, I need a seperate block for conditionally rendering the modal of checkPost type. Okay, well, long overdue on walking Dawa, little trooper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; though, the linking URI worked! What! It wasn‚Äôt working last time I checked! Miiiight have to rethink whether the image needs to be made square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I will wake up with some answers and some motivation tomorrow! Sleeping in (until six :)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes!

Okay, shake it out, code it out, code it up, let‚Äôs do it up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve got this phone call at 1 o‚Äôclock today and the anticipation is tangible! I‚Äôm going to work on Logoed until then, and then I promised Dawa a bike ride! Hope for the best, prepare for the worst, if this goes well it could literally change my life, if it doesn‚Äôt, it needs to not be the end of the world. Inhale. Exhale. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where were we with Logoed? Just handled the new dependencies and imports, time to try and convert the Logoing screen to a functional component and get that information box to icon thing working, which is like 90% of the reason I‚Äôm working on this project again. Crazy how you can just wake up with your brain on fire sometimes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, wait, navigation first. I guess I don‚Äôt really need to be using context there, but I‚Äôll want that wired up when actual user data happens, maybe I‚Äôll just leave it, though the ProfileCreation and Logoing stacks can get combined. // Oh maybe &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; though, I can‚Äôt see where to conditionally pass in an initialRoute ‚Ä¶ I guess if the ProfileCreation screen rendered null until it checked for the piece of context ‚Ä¶ You know, let me see if it checks the parent navigator for a screen named BusinessSelection, I imagine that‚Äôs a better way of doing this ‚Ä¶ Nnnope, not BusinessSelection ‚Ä¶ Oh, lol, doesn‚Äôt have to navigate at all, it needs to set the context, herp derp ‚Ä¶ which ‚Ä¶ is not conditionally rendering the Logoing stack ‚Ä¶ maybe it‚Äôs part of the root stack though? Weird! Only the other screen that wasn‚Äôt part of that block is accessible! Oh, whoa, pop isn‚Äôt working either. Wait but if I set a useContext to be fired by instagramHandle[0], RootStack rerenders? I‚Äôve got to restart the packager and reinstall the app to make sure that‚Äôs not a bug. Nope, it was a bug, lol, it‚Äôs definitely calling that function, but not rerendering ‚Ä¶ Oh whhhyyy, okay, let me try and change this ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm changing the useState function, the setState in useEffect, the value passed to the Provider, which is where I think it might break, and I‚Äôll try passing the whole array if it does ‚Ä¶ and the condition in the return statement ‚Ä¶ oh wait, I‚Äôm &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; going to change the value passed to the provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, yea, no, it did not like that. Oh boy ‚Ä¶ Okay, so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Context and Conditional Rendering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works, I‚Äôm not super sure why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ProfileCreationContext&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;import { createContext } from &amp;#39;react&amp;#39;;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;export const ProfileCreationContext = createContext(null);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Navigation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;import { ProfileCreationContext } from &amp;#39;../contexts&amp;#39;;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;const RootStack = createStackNavigator();&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;const RootStackScreen = () =&amp;gt; {&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;const instagramHandle = useState(null);&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;useEffect(() =&amp;gt; {&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;instagramHandle[1](instagramHandle[0]);&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;}, [instagramHandle[0]]);&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;return (&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ProfileCreationContext.Provider value={instagramHandle}&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;RootStack.Navigator&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;{&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;instagramHandle[0] ? (&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;RootStack.Screen name=&amp;quot;LogoingStack&amp;quot; component={LogoingStackScreen} /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;) : (&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;RootStack.Screen name=&amp;quot;ProfileCreationStack&amp;quot; component={ProfileCreationStackScreen} /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;... ...&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ProfileCreation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;import { ProfileCreationContext } from &amp;#39;../contexts&amp;#39;;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;export const ProfileCreation = ({ navigation, route }) =&amp;gt; {&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;const [instagramHandle, setInstagramHandle] = useContext(ProfileCreationContext);&lt;/code&gt;
‚Ä¶ Oh, wait, ProfileCreation doesn‚Äôt need that context any more ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Modal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;import { ProfileCreationContext } from &amp;#39;../contexts&amp;#39;;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;export const Modal = ({ navigation, route }) =&amp;gt; {&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;const { type } = route.params;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;const [instagramHandle, setInstagramHandle] = useContext(ProfileCreationContext);&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;return (&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;TouchableOpacity onPress={() =&amp;gt; setInstagramHandle(route.params.handle)}&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶ putting whitespace in backticks in markdown gets formatted out on save ‚Ä¶ herp derp ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WAIT NO IT DOESN‚ÄôT WORK?!?! WHAAAT?!?!?! I swear, if removing the console.log broke it ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oooohkay, it‚Äôs a race condition between the parent rerendering the stack and the onPress function running. Maybe. Sometimes it works with a 35ms setTimeout, sometimes it doesn‚Äôt. 40ms is acceptable. Wtf though. Okay:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Modal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;import { ProfileCreationContext } from &amp;#39;../contexts&amp;#39;;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;export const Modal = ({ navigation, route }) =&amp;gt; {&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;const { type } = route.params;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;const [instagramHandle, setInstagramHandle] = useContext(ProfileCreationContext);&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;return (&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;TouchableOpacity onPress={() =&amp;gt; {&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;setInstagramHandle(route.params.handle);&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;setTimeout(() =&amp;gt; {&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;navigation.navigate({ name: &amp;quot;LogoingStack&amp;quot; });&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;}, 40)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;}}&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crazy. I feel like if I had more experience writing promise generators I‚Äôd do something with those here ‚Ä¶ or &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;, I don‚Äôt know ‚Ä¶ so hacky!! Anyway, &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; to tackle the Logoing screen ‚Ä¶ or walk Dawa again lol. // Well, &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; had a nice walk and a juggle ‚Ä¶ I took Dawa out, but it‚Äôs windy, so he was afraid and we went back in. Sigh. On to coding!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I‚Äôve definitely grown as a developer, because there‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;no way&lt;/em&gt; I would have written code like the old Logoing screen today. Whoa. Big oof. Pen and paper time for the layout. And another walk. //&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazing how much a walk can do. Before all the code had just kinda started to blend together, now I think I get the heirarchy, what needs to happen onSnapShot, and I‚Äôm going to just go with the React Native flex implementation with inline styles rather than try and figure out how to get the same effect with styled-components ‚Ä¶ for the moment. I‚Äôve got an hour, it would be dope if I can get this working. //&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well in epidsode three hundred and forty two of Gareth Is A Silly Goose, apparently Calendly sends Google Calendar invites with a Google Hangout link, so, lesson learned, and ‚Ä¶ call? rescheduled. I thought the email back with my phone number would have done it, but I bet that the person sending the Calendly invite was aware of how it worked and didn‚Äôt get any prompts to prompt &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; to check my Google Calendar invites. Or maybe I live under a rock. I‚Äôm back and forth between feeling like the embodiment of ‚ÄúOnce Down Is No Battle,‚Äù and feeling really, really shitty, so I‚Äôm going to dive back into this React Native project so that it‚Äôs the RSOD telling me I‚Äôm shitty and not my own head. External forces are easier to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes,
~g&lt;/p&gt;

First and &lt;strong&gt;WOW&lt;/strong&gt; I got contacted by a startup that‚Äôs hiring!!! They‚Äôre a React/React Native/Node shop, and want to build a diverse, inclusive team!!! I need to hope for the best and prepare for the worst, of course, but OMG!!! My fingers are crossed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, second, last night I was like, sure computer, you want to upgrade the operating system, go for it, and today I woke up to bash being deprecated, which umm ‚Ä¶ whole new world here, lol. I installed &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh&quot;&gt;oh-my-zsh&lt;/a&gt; and pasted in my .bash_profile, and it doesn‚Äôt seem too‚Ä¶ different, I haven‚Äôt tried to run a React Native project yet. Eep. So many plugins though! Very temped to install the Chuck Norris and Cat-speak ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here goes ‚Ä¶ hope it works! If I can get what I want to get done on the Logoed project before talking to this person, that would be awesooome ‚Ä¶ this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; React Native we‚Äôre talking about though, so I‚Äôve got time to make and eat a salad and make another coffee before it loads, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sahweet! Course I was greeted with an error, and I‚Äôm not sure what I did to break it, but game on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm going to post this up, I‚Äôm so stoked, and there‚Äôs a shortage of good news these days, heh ‚Ä¶ WOOT though!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Lol, so I fixed the bug &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; before the tweaker guy went by yelling. Fml, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awesome, though, Got to the Logoing screen. Which I still have to build, but I‚Äôve built it before, this won‚Äôt be too difficult, he says, lol. Come to Connecticut, they said. It‚Äôs a little quieter, they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uh-oh, no ruby ‚Ä¶ save me homebrew you‚Äôre my only hope? Yay! Also, thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/8955&quot;&gt;everyone in the GitHub issues!&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;brew install cocoapods ruby &amp;amp;&amp;amp; brew link --overwrite cocoapods&lt;/code&gt; did it for me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, I broke the ProfileCreation screen ‚Ä¶ when did I do that? Whooaah, it just lagged massively ‚Ä¶ weird, lol. Whaaat and an affirmative response didn‚Äôt load the BusinessSelection screen! Wait, I should do that whole thing differently anyway, hold on ‚Ä¶ lol, though reloading the JavaScript bundle fixed all the glitches ‚Ä¶ come on :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, so this is interesting ‚Ä¶ currently, the root navigator relies on Context to render either the ProfileCreation stack, which itself only has one screen, navigates to the Modal within the root navigator for a confirmation screen, and then either sets the Context so that the Logoing stack is displayed, or doesn‚Äôt if the response from the modal isn‚Äôt affirmative, and then I was like, well this should clearly just navigate to the BusinessSelection screen on affirmative, but it‚Äôs not in the same stack ‚Ä¶ which, I should try it, might actually just work based on react-native navigate actions tending to fall back to the level above if it doesn‚Äôt find a screen with that name, but that‚Äôs a silly way of doing it if being explicit about it is just as easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANOTHER company reached out! WHOA!!! SOOO stressful answering the salary question though! I asked Reactiflux about it, maybe they have some words of reassurance :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone ever feel extremely uncomfortable answering the, ‚ÄúWhat do you expect your salary to be?‚Äù question? I‚Äôve never really had an actually salaried job in tech, just a freelance gig or two, and I think I‚Äôm, like, okay, but compared to the minimum wage that I‚Äôm used to working retail (doing my best! :slight_smile: ) the amount that I feel I should be responding to this question with just feels absolutely ludicrous ‚Ä¶ Like ‚Ä¶ I basically just wrote a number down that I pulled out of my ‚Ä¶ pulled out of the back of my mind remembering the State of JavaScript survey and divided by 12, and even then I lowered it twice before actually sending the message ‚Ä¶ like ‚Ä¶ a pat on the back and a crust of bread every once and a while would probably seem like too much, and I know, I know, rent, but holy moley ‚Ä¶ is this really the world we‚Äôre living in? Like, I‚Äôve been working at this when I can for like six years now, but it doesn‚Äôt feel real, you know? ‚Äî Twitchkidd&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ooof, where was I? Ahh, there‚Äôs only so much daylight here, dog-walking time again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Okay, this has turned into a tomorrow morning question. There‚Äôs only so much being out in the cold I can take. It‚Äôs April, definitely ready for some Spring-like temperatures. The orchid is budding, though! This in parting:&lt;/p&gt;

Batched a bunch of phone calls this morning, and it absolutely sapped my mental energy for the day. Communicating with a very small number of other people about something we are enthusiastic about boosts my energy, communicating with a large number, (lol, nine,) about things none of us are enthusiastic about ‚Ä¶ nothing quite like it to suck the life force out of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handled that, treated the dog well, ate healthy food and kept the kitchen clean, and I &lt;strong&gt;cannot wait&lt;/strong&gt; for tomorrow morning when I know where I stand, financially and in terms of responsibilities, and can dig back in and rock and roll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a positive note, I thought to myself today, &lt;em&gt;imagine&lt;/em&gt; if I‚Äôd tried to actually get a serious job as a dev a year ago? I‚Äôve gotten &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much better, and if I can push through, even though we‚Äôre kinda on the edge right now, Dawa and I, my little fam, it‚Äôs looking like 2020 is going to be the year of getting our **** together. There‚Äôs a lot to be excited about, but I‚Äôm totally tapped for to ‚Ä¶ day ‚Ä¶ as the upstairs neighbor burns something and sets the smoke alarm off, lol. Hoping the apartment people have another unit I can move to, even though I &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; got Internet set up. I can deal with loud music or crying babies, but the tweaker guy barking curses as he goes by my apartment every day is going to throw me over the edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow though, a little better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes, ~g&lt;/p&gt;

(Everything Black by Unlike Pluto)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaaaalright! I‚Äôve got to be more focused than yesterday. Or ‚Ä¶ well, focused on the right things, because I definitely got some practice in trying to solve something seemingly intractable ‚Ä¶ and failed, lol ‚Ä¶ but I can still develop the iOS app, and I‚Äôve got to make as much progress as I possibly can today so that I can have busted this out over the weekend and send it along to Dave, and be free to work on other things. So:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the list sort, list select, and QR code select working&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the route param to Logoing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up the Logoing screen, that‚Äôs the camera, camera roll button, shutter, draggable logo, and the instructions tooltip that‚Äôs got to animate into the question mark icon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That icon, tapping it should animate back out that instructions box ‚Ä¶ and the first time it should be up for like a second and a half, and tapping anywhere should close it, then subsequent times it should be up ‚Ä¶ five seconds? Indefinitely? Tapping anywhere should close it though. Maybe after five seconds an okay button should pop up?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyway, get the camera and react-native-viewshot wired up, get the image, save it to the camera roll, or if that‚Äôs cancelled go back to logoing, and then navigate to sharing, which I think I need to split up into the caption copying phase and the share to Instagram phase, because that‚Äôs just a lot to expect of people that they‚Äôll digest everything in one screen. So screen one might be more instruction heavy, and have a button that copies the caption and gives you a nice animated check, good job, and then the next screen should have some more instruction and have an open Instagram button and an ‚ÄòI did it‚Äô button, which should be disabled until the open Instagram button is pressed, and then that should hypothetically ping the server to check and see if they actually did it, send them to loading, and if it returns good, send them on to the home screen with the drawer and a pointer for where to see the status of the raffle or their reward or whatever we‚Äôre going, and then if it doesn‚Äôt, give them the error message and send them back to the logoing screen ‚Ä¶ with the full stack history so if they don‚Äôt want to take another picture and know how to navigate with gestures, they can swipe forward. Maybe even add to the instruction box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting the server up and ready will be a whole other thing. Should puh-robably wait until I hear back from the other devs/Dave. I can start on Run Club though, I just learned a ton about auth, navigation, etc etc. Okay go!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, first thing was getting the actual app to launch, right? I brought a bunch of the files over from the last time I used React Native, and it‚Äôs trying to load dependencies and breaking ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh jeez, I just checked Google Analytics and people are actually going to my website. Oh boy. Maybe revisit that before Run Club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oop, step one, I set the isLoading flag off to try and bust through not having Internet on the emulator ‚Ä¶ //&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, I got way further with the list sort going, typing in the TextInput filters the list! It‚Äôs beautiful! And the route param is definitely being passed along. I took Dawa for another walk and put myself together, and I‚Äôm going to go over things from the navigation level again with my second cup of coffee to get my head back into it here. // Ooor I‚Äôm going to talk with the student loans people for a bit. Yay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ooof, okay, just fixed up the auth flow and the forms, learned about putting things you need to happen based on awaited values up in the try part of a try-catch rather than after, and the Formik is great, but the little things I‚Äôm doing with inputs and how easy it is to use state and handlers makes it more of a hassle than it‚Äôs worth right now. And now we have app icons again yaaay :) Yea, that was totally broken though, if there was an access token in storage, it was just setting loading to false whether it worked or not, and then when I had auth set up recursively, I had the recursion set up wrong so it kept ‚Ä¶ on ‚Ä¶ running ‚Ä¶ tryAuth() ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My back is killing me, first upgrade purchase, unless it‚Äôs a webcam, needs to be a new chair. Can‚Äôt find handleSubmit ‚Ä¶ hmm ‚Ä¶ ah, handleFormSubmit ‚Ä¶ ooo, and the hasTextBeenChanged state and the button being disabled worked, but it should automatically blow away the placeholder onFocus probably ‚Ä¶ ooo, nice, got KeyboardAvaoidingView working, and wrapping the Text in a View stopped it from jumping up. Oh, and sending back params rather than sending callback functions through, that makes sense ‚Ä¶ unless it causes ProfileCreation to rerender jankily. Ugh, it does. That‚Äôs got to be a later thing though, it‚Äôs noon, and I‚Äôve fixed some things, but broken very little new ground. //&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alrighty, got WiFi! Didn‚Äôt realize it was Monday, and not Sunday, until the WiFi guy called though, lol. Also my computer hasn‚Äôt magically gotten better, oh well. I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; get a new cable that goes to the hard drive though! Apparently that‚Äôs what‚Äôs failing, not the hard drives, because I plugged a brand new hard drive in and it didn‚Äôt see &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; one either. I‚Äôm not sure what to do now, exactly ‚Ä¶ I have a todo list that‚Äôs just like the whole page next to me. Inhale. Exhale. Please can the debugger connect ‚Ä¶ frozen at 4791/4791 ‚Ä¶ reboot everything, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, awesome, list sort just needs case sensitivity and changing how submit works, select works, just maybe if they start to backspace that gets handled better ‚Ä¶ oo, maybe showing the last time it changed? I could go down a rabbit hole there, also styling isn‚Äôt great, logos aren‚Äôt included yada yada. Sends the prop along though! I wonder if the couch might hurt my back less, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweet relief! Except that Dawa is now ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmm ‚Ä¶ so the CodeScanner screen works ‚Ä¶ sort of. It takes apart the url properly, it seems, and navigates to ‚ÄúLogoing‚Äù, and passes along the business ‚Ä¶ the barcode reader seems to keep on going though, like the camera is still on ‚Ä¶ I wonder if conditionally rendering the whole screen would do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Oh boy. React Native development is great when it‚Äôs great ‚Ä¶ not so much when it‚Äôs not. Oh, it finally loaded. Holy moley. Why is the network suddenly dead though? Ahhhhh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! Conditionally rendering the CodeScanner screen totally shut down the camera! Starting to lose the ability to focus, though. Good day! Not as much done as I would have liked, but some solid progress where I thought I might get stuck. To the future!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And best wishes! ~g&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to pull the plug on this until I get Internet and/or my physical device back, I can‚Äôt seem to connect to the Internet from the emulator. Back to iOS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve gotten so much done today so far! Must keep going! Up since 5:30 and got the BusinessSelection screen wired up, context doing its thing ‚Ä¶ oof, just spent three hours trying to get the Android emulator to connect. Brutal.&lt;/p&gt;

Oof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, not really sure where to jump in today. There‚Äôs more auth stuff to tidy up, or I was thinking of seeing what libraries were out there to handle search in React Native, since I really have no idea where I‚Äôd start there ‚Ä¶ I mean, I guess you just have the list of things, and display a FlatList, and then onChangeText you filter for ones that include that string? Huh, actually, I could do that. Maybe. Let‚Äôs see. How about I go over the auth thing one more time, maybe there will be some low hanging fruit and I can get my fingers flying, and then we try the search thing, and then I was thinking, since it looks like the Instagram API is on total lock-down these days, it might be prudent to see if I could write a node service that hits instagram.com/{user-name} and whether pulling the profile pic in would be feasible. Which is spelled &lt;em&gt;f-e-a-s-i-b-l-e&lt;/em&gt; ‚Ä¶ gotta see about a spell-checker in this thing. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaand yelling tweaker outside my window. Great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaand navigation options have stopped working entirely. Can‚Äôt header none, can‚Äôt change the header title even. What. // Now it works after deleting and reinstalling the app. Yay. Half an hour later ‚Ä¶ // Oop, it‚Äôs back. Why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RNDebugger: Network tab, DISABLE CACHE!!! //&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alrighty, much later. Mental health somewhat rejuvenated, got Dawa for a brief run, then got one in myself, had some soup, made coffee, took Dawa out again, back to it here. Listened to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://devchat.tv/react-native-radio/rnr-160-react-native-at-shopify-with-ryan-christiani/&quot;&gt;React Native Radio podcast with Ryan Christiani&lt;/a&gt; at Shopify, what was pretty dope. I downloaded that as soon as I saw it, since I‚Äôd just worked with some of their embedded code on the Lyme Art Association, which waaas ‚Ä¶ yea. A learning experience, for sure, and also definitely a confidence booster, seeing it live on the Internet, even through the rest of the site is still ‚Ä¶ it still needs work, but that‚Äôs something they can find a budget for or live with :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where were we? I just found out that you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; pass callback functions through route params, but the yellow box yelled at me for it, so that‚Äôs a question mark, and then building out the business selection page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahh, small things eat my time! That‚Äôs part of it, though, and part of why I‚Äôm so bad at estimating how long something will take :\ Like, why is this simple CenteringView component making everything nearly invisible? And then so, my phone is much faster than the simulator that runs on my laptop, but the cord doesn‚Äôt like to stay connected, so it‚Äôll lose connection every time I shake it to pull up the debug menu or reload it. Bleurgh. Let‚Äôs try the simulator ‚Ä¶ // Oh, this &lt;em&gt;sucks!&lt;/em&gt; The simulator is running just too slowly, like, the keyboard just doesn‚Äôt want to load up, I‚Äôve got to try the device again. Or maybe hack on Android ‚Ä¶ because the iPhone 6 simulator was working okay at least, but with Xcode 11, I‚Äôd have to download it, and my Internet still isn‚Äôt installed and I‚Äôm out of high-speed hotspot. Ahh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay ‚Ä¶ hitting debug reconnects everything, I‚Äôm getting fast updates, I‚Äôm not getting build errors for the moment, got styled-components up and running ‚Ä¶ huh, weird, nothing in the Formik component reacted to KeyboardAvoidingView, though the text above it did. Oh well, I don‚Äôt need that right &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; ‚Ä¶ and maybe it‚Äôs just that the whole thing needs to be one component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oof, where do we leave off today? Heard from Oluwatobitowa, he‚Äôs just been busy, good to know he‚Äôs okay, and I‚Äôm about to expand into more React Native stuff, server stuff, hopefully figuring out context and react-navigation very soon, I‚Äôm going to work hard to bust out something that will hopefully be useful for Dave and co. and something to put on the resume, going to take Monday for paperwork/admin stuff because &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; is crazy right now, good night though aaand:&lt;/p&gt;

Woke up with the design solution for Logoed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, been rocking and rolling for forty-five minutes here, getting auth going after sketching everything out, a question for later, can you have top-level contexts in a Gatsby app? Does that make sense? Oof, okay, copy and pasted the code in, need to walk the dog again before I can wire it up and test it out. //&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, where are we? It‚Äôs been the type of day where I‚Äôm going back and forth between losing myself in the zone and getting annoyed that my dog isn‚Äôt using his little legs. Possibly haircut time for Dawa. Mostly I‚Äôve been working on auth, which, like how much time have I spent on auth at this point, but I really feel like I‚Äôve leveled up! And, so, haven‚Äôt gotten too far with like actually implementing the new design, and apparently there are other devs on the Logoed project now, which is pretty sweet, I gotta just bust this out real quick though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AHH I DID SO MUCH TODAY AND GOT SO FAR ‚Ä¶ AND IN THE END, IT DOESN‚ÄôT REALLY MATTER? No, it does matter, I got so much further than I would have last year, and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre looking for, but ‚Ä¶ oh my God, there are sounds coming from &lt;strong&gt;everywhere&lt;/strong&gt; right now, and I can‚Äôt handle it ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;// Oh, I just did so much and didn‚Äôt write any of it down! Whooooops! I‚Äôll leave a little easter egg by making a commit called ‚Äòeaster‚Äô ‚Ä¶ look at the console and click the hamburger :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, dog-walking time, made a lot of progress, will be definitely happy when I‚Äôve gotten toggling the menu to render a menu, throwing some actual content in the main panels, and then there‚Äôs an accordian example in the tabs repo, so mobile optimization next! I should save that for tomorrow though, and end today on being happier with the desktop version. Oh, just found a bug where the scale thing means if you click within 10% of the edge it doesn‚Äôt register an event ‚Ä¶ maybe I scale to 110? No, that looks awful, 0.95 then.&lt;/p&gt;

Not feeling it, but it‚Äôs time to (you guessed it) do the work. Okay, deep breath‚Ä¶]]></description><link>https://www.garethfield.com/do-the-work/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.garethfield.com/do-the-work/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 25 Mar 2020 08:53:11 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;IN WHICH GARETH DOES THE WORK, lol. That kinda morning. Not feeling it, but it‚Äôs time to (you guessed it) do the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, deep breath. Tabs. Implement tabs. Make tabs pretty. Next step forms. Make form. Make auth. Make menu for auth route. Switch projects. Make auth for projects. Make server. Handle auth for projects with server. Make forms for projects. Step 11: profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time estimation practice! Implementing tabs: three minutes, 8:54 - 8:57, go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶ 9:24. So only ten times off, lol. What happened? Let‚Äôs see ‚Ä¶ the Nav component was off somewhere, so had to do that whole deal, and then I was rendering Buttons within Tabs when the Tabs were rendering buttons, also I had to use the restroom, also I got distracted and had to fix my tabs-test project, and then I forgot to destructure { onClick } from useTabsState(). Also, remember if you want to use a switch statement again in your JSX, the trick is to use an IIFE. Oof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm ‚Ä¶ just deleted work from this file ‚Ä¶ estimated that I‚Äôd be done with the next step by ten, from 9:36, so 24 minutes ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs 9:51 ‚Ä¶ what did I do with those icons? AAYYY, in ../dep/before-gastby/src/assets! Lolll ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eugh, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sudo yarn add yada-yada&lt;/code&gt; ‚Ä¶ no beuno! I have to nuke this machine soon. 10:12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, why is saving/formatting taking forever? Whoop, turn it off, back on again, works. Eep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahh, I get so frustrated with CSS! With JS, you can just console log something and it‚Äôll tell you what‚Äôs happening, unless it lies to you because it was pushed to the end of the call stack or it‚Äôs a reference error or something, with CSS ‚Ä¶ well, I mean, it‚Äôs my own incompetence, I‚Äôve got to look in the mirror on this, not out the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; issue is ‚Äúhow to SVG?‚Äù I mean, I was able to load them through Gatsby by using the graphql query for their public url, as they‚Äôre in the assets folder at build time, and then they worked as the source of image tags, but how to access their svg properties, to like change the color? Solution 1 is to go into the svg files and add the stroke color manually, which I could do but would be sub-optimal, as I‚Äôd have to have multiple files with different colors and switch between them if I wanted to change them like on hover, then a slightly better Solution 2 could be to use string interpolation and inject the variable that way, but like, also unwieldly, and then Solutions 3 through 5 are to set them as the background image of a div and filter the background, or figure out the ‚Äòuse‚Äô tag, or some other way, because this is sort of all a bit of a mystery to me. Solution 6 is pick another library, let‚Äôs see what we can do though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huh, okay, so stack overflow had a solution using a namespaced href, xlink:href, for use tags, but React said no can do, but MDN had just an href attribute ‚Ä¶ so they‚Äôre ‚Ä¶ 0 x 34px ‚Ä¶ whoa ‚Ä¶ okay, so the solution, for the moment, is to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp&quot;&gt;this CodePen by Barrett Sonntag&lt;/a&gt; to get a ‚Äòfilter‚Äô for the svg imported into an image in the desired color. Hacky af, but it is what it is! //&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ooohhkeeeday! I‚Äôm going a little crazy here between the coughing neighbors and the yelling tweaker neighbors and that it‚Äôs just &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; cold, and I can‚Äôt seem to warm up, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-use-react-context-effectively&quot;&gt;the article recommended to me yesterday on Reactiflux by Kent C. Dodds&lt;/a&gt; was a breath of fresh air, and even though I didn‚Äôt totally understand 100% of it right away, it gave me confidence that there‚Äôs a mesa of sanity, where if you can reach it, you can see what the heck is going on here with state management in React. I‚Äôm going to do my best to take the step back I need to take right now and get the styling right for these tabby-bits, and we‚Äôll do it up. (‚Ä¶what? Whatever, go!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mmm, nope. Nope nope. Done. Other things just happened. Work will resume tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes, ~g.&lt;/p&gt;

I think if I can avoid doing anything traumatic, and just handle the tightness from the muscle wanting to protect the tendon, and do enough barefoot training and functional cross training, I might just become a runner again. More on that later. Time to code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to ‚Ä¶ time to connect where I got to with prop-drilling, and where my dude Yusuff is trying to get me to with context, first with class components, and then, apparently more simply, with functional components. Pen and paper time, for sure, my brain just isn‚Äôt there yet, even after the second cup of coffee ‚Ä¶ should be kicking in here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVM! Functional first! Wtf ‚Ä¶ not going to touch the class component thing unless I need to. At first I was like oh no, hooks scary, it took very, very little time to switch though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so next up is taking a look at that tabs library again, now that createContext/useContext aren‚Äôt a total mistery. Dog walk first. Maybe grab a beer. #Random on Reactiflux had some serious racists breezing through. Handled it well, though, didn‚Äôt rise to any name-calling, and continued conversation with non-trolls. Upsetting, though. TO THE FUTURE! //&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I‚Äôm looking at the source for this tabs library, and now that I‚Äôve seen createContext/useContext used in a more concrete setting, and understand that the children as function thing ‚Ä¶ is a thing ‚Ä¶ at least it‚Äôs not Greek to me, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to try and understand all of what‚Äôs going on there and just use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweet! Got a demo with the styling/wrappers I‚Äôm using on this site going in a little test project, and you know what? That will be it for today! Helped a few people on Reactiflux, posted my resume there (ahh!) did some networking on the Twitters, listened to React Native Radio, the most recent episode with Jared Palmer on Formik, which I want to try to throw into a project because now I get it, you pass whatever web/native form inputs to it and render a big ole Formik and it gives you the magic, along with the error handling with the same type of names going on, and yup is like the schema library they like the best and have a special prop for, I dig it, aaand I‚Äôm tired and am going to bed. Good night!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes! ~g&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, he‚Äôs out and about, so I‚Äôm going to keep going with my own stuff for the moment. Taking a look at the tabs with hooks library, I‚Äôm going to try to grok that before using it. Except Dawa needs another walk soo ‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs fork the repo and see about that new GitHub mobile app // ‚Ä¶ which worked perfectly, except I don‚Äôt know why the repos aren‚Äôt listed chronologically, but the thing is it‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;freezing&lt;/em&gt; out and my fingers froze, trying to hold my phone. I‚Äôve got a podcast where a Nigerian developer is being interviewed going on, so I‚Äôm going to kind of type my stream of consciousness and hopefully out the other side I‚Äôll be ready to rock and roll. The things I‚Äôm working on right now are this tabs thing, and implementing it on my website, which is going to get me leveled up with hooks, because it uses useCallback, useMemo, createContext, and useContext ‚Ä¶ and then also I‚Äôve implemented the navigation I want to see, basically, for the RunClub app, but I still need to work out how that‚Äôs going to go for the Moodbit app ‚Ä¶ oh, it‚Äôs snowing ‚Ä¶ arrg. Okay, then so I still need to be applying for jobs here, and reaching out to my social network, and then I need to handle the life insurance people today, and I should get back to my father about the rest of the stuff down on Long Island. Then getting some supplies, and making some soup. Oh, and if I can get my video call setup down, that would be awesome if Elsbeth can help me test that. I should message my guy at Logoed, too. We‚Äôre going to have a window of time when restaurants open back up, so there could be some pressure to take advantage of that. I think that‚Äôll be the first thing I tackle, then tabs, then customizing my website with it, then maybe filling out some more of the main content, at least on the ‚Äòcoding‚Äô tab, like to show my GitHub and my resume. I‚Äôm shoveling popcorn into my face because this last walk was &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; frustrating. I know that‚Äôs a me problem, both with the relationship to food and my anger issues. Room to grow. Lol, if I keep eating this popcorn, growing is definitely in the plans, haha. I meant to work out today, when I was thinking about it yesterday, because I got a long barefoot walk in, then the next day I got a barefoot run in, and then yesterday I got a run in with Dawa, and my Achilles injury was definitely trying to flare up ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the tendon still injured, or that the muscle around it is just used to being so tight to protect the tendon. My back is killing me, too. I know it‚Äôs my own fault again, but my dog just like, doesn‚Äôt walk with me, he‚Äôs super anxious and will just take off at the slightest noise and yank me off to the side while I‚Äôm holding a tea to keep my fingers warm and my phone to try and keep in the coding zone, and breaking the interruption, plus the cold, plus my back pain, I get so mad! And in this small apartment I‚Äôm stuck in, there‚Äôs nowhere to get away from him, and he growls at like a plastic bag floating by, and I‚Äôm going to make another coffee because I don‚Äôt sleep well these days, but how am I going to focus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, OpenCollective, though, that sounds dope! Issues have price tags attached? Alright!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eugh, and the weather is supposed to just get worse all day. Okay, coffee is made, I‚Äôm going to focus as much as possible for the next hour and blast through. Let‚Äôs go!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, thank you pen and paper, got the logic hypothetically sorted. Global stack for modals and alerts, conditionally the auth stack with sign in/up, and profile creation, the logoing stack with biz select, logoing, and sharing screens, then the home drawer with the thank you/landing screen, ‚ÄòLogoing, take 2!‚Äô as a FAB maybe, and profile, rewards, terms of service, feedback, and settings screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, no, do not look outside, do not look on twitter, or through open collective projects. Code, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;****! I &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; be testing the navigation logic for the Logoed app, but Xcode is updating and might not finish because I only have a limited amount of data my phone can pump out as a hotspot, which is BS! Whole point of getting unlimited data :\&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, well, on the line with Frontier, because the other option is a Comcast company, so like, lesser of two evils ‚Ä¶ Eugh and speaking of, Starbucks is providing catastrophe pay, so yay, except didn‚Äôt get back to me when I needed it last week, even with documentation, so boo, and also they‚Äôre staying open! Like ‚Ä¶ seriously ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, &lt;em&gt;well,&lt;/em&gt; I can work on the web side of things as the build tools don‚Äôt need Xcode, which is hanging at 99% ‚Ä¶ though I guess I could use the Android emulator, silly me, let‚Äôs try that. ‚Ä¶ Nope ‚Ä¶ oh, wait, I went and ordered Internet service and made soup, and now it‚Äôs on 99% executing ‚Ä¶ guess how long I‚Äôm going to have soup for, too, lol. Is it all week? Oh yea. ‚Ä¶ [51m, 41s] ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, &lt;em&gt;well,&lt;/em&gt; I can work on the web side of things. // Omg, did Xcode finish? Eh, I mean, good time to learn &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;useContext&lt;/code&gt; ‚Ä¶ from a Nigerian developer who writes for Smashing! Go give &lt;a href=&quot;twitter.com/faruqyusuffG&quot;&gt;Yasuff Faruq&lt;/a&gt; a follow!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohhkay, though ‚Ä¶ okay, look, let he without sin cast the first stone, right? And it‚Äôs probably a good thing that I can‚Äôt follow along exactly with the demo and just type in code blindly, that it‚Äôs not exposited coherently just means I have to figure out not what he said, but what he &lt;em&gt;meant,&lt;/em&gt; and that‚Äôs a skill more worth developing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day here, I got the Logoed project to render, I‚Äôve got this context example with themes ready to go, I dealt with the Starbucks people, I dealt with the Internet people, I found some Nigerian devs (they‚Äôre out there!) and some Nigerian solar companies, I made soup, I cared for my dog, I know that Big Nerd Farm is a place to apply, I discovered Open Collective ‚Ä¶ tomorrow let‚Äôs see if I can be in the zone for a little longer and get a workout in. The rain stops at 2 or 3am, so I‚Äôll get Dawa out for a brief one at some point this evening, another early early tomorrow morning, hopefully I can get to sleep, and there‚Äôs vegetables for a low-carb morning, get a run in maybe ‚Ä¶ hopefully nobody has actually read this tosh, however if so!:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes! ~g&lt;/p&gt;

Step one is reboot my React Native projects with what I learned yesterday about react-navigation 5: use it, don‚Äôt lose it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a quick aside, if you‚Äôre out there in the ether, Dave, miss you buddy. (Use it!) (I‚Äôm doin‚Äô it, Dave!) //&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; good start to returning to React Native ‚Ä¶ Xcode wouldn‚Äôt update until I &lt;strong&gt;set the system time to October 19th, 2019&lt;/strong&gt; so it could update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still waiting for it to build ‚Ä¶ woot. Helping a person on Reactiflux though, yay for that, and first sip of hot coffee for the day! Please kick in, lol. I made tea for our first walk today, (ooo the package manager just launched!!!) and sucked down the rest of the cold brew from yesterday with some granola and soy milk, nothing quite like hot coffee though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my goal here is to implement navigation (build succeeded!!!!!) for RunClub and Logoed, which I just sketched out. Let‚Äôs try an iPhone 8 simulator rather than the iPhone 11 Pro Max, which my 2012 machine I think was struggling to launch, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still taking a while. In the meantime, let‚Äôs do tabs in React with hooks! Thanks for the help here &lt;a href=&quot;github.com/jetiss/tabs&quot;&gt;Jetiss!&lt;/a&gt; ‚Ä¶ Oh, this is a library ‚Ä¶ eh, c‚Äôest la vie. Eh, you know, I‚Äôm going to look at the source and do it myself maybe. Or the coffee is going to totally overwhelm me, oh no, lol ‚Ä¶ //&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeap, took Dawa for a run, did some et cetera work, back at it though! In touch with my dude Oliwatobitowa, he‚Äôs working through w3schools at the moment, and my dude at the dog park said that he‚Äôd do more with computers if he had a better laptop, so I‚Äôm seeing if I can‚Äôt get my second machine running again ‚Ä¶ ahh, okay, back to work on the React Native apps, the iPhone 8 simulator works much better on this, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Omg, navigation is sooooo much nicer now! I took like, sum total (dog walk in-between) fifteen minutes to scaffold out a whole design, or at least the navigation through it, and it just worked, and my app feels like it has legs again. Holy moley. Let me try that with Logoed ‚Ä¶ yea, this is going to be amazing. I‚Äôm so stoked. I‚Äôm also so tired, and I need to cook dinner for Dawa, and I should cook dinner for myself, too, but honestly I think snack foods are on the menu and winding down and passing out is on the docket. Good day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I ordered another hard drive because it was less than $20, and if I can get this other computer working, maybe this other dude‚Äôs life can get leveled up. I dunno, but like, I‚Äôm motivated to help others, and not so much else, except like ‚Ä¶ I mean I‚Äôll do enough administrative stuff/playing the game so I won‚Äôt get in trouble, hypothetically, and I‚Äôll do what I have to do to stay sane and have a good time, but beyond that, helping other people level up is like my main driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm going to be helping someone from Nigeria learn JavaScript! His name is Oluwatobiloba, and we connected through Twitter! &lt;a href=&quot;twitter.com/TTmovic&quot;&gt;Give him a follow!&lt;/a&gt; //&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this morning I cleaned the apartment, so I‚Äôm definitely in a better headspace to be able to code, even with the tweaker yelling curses outside. Next thing I‚Äôm going to work on is getting through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reactnativeschool.com/master-react-navigation-v5&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react-navigation&lt;/code&gt; version 5 tutorial by Handlebar Labs&lt;/a&gt; because I haven‚Äôt touched React Native in a minute and this is like essential, and it‚Äôs a Saturday and I slept in and don‚Äôt feel like doing career stuff, so there :p&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh the API is so much better! Also, yay, I didn‚Äôt lose my React Native chops, and totally guessed how to call the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;toggleDrawer&lt;/code&gt; function correctly! // Aaand done! I will call today productive! (And try to work more later, let‚Äôs see though, lol) ‚Ä¶ /// (Didn‚Äôt happen, cya tomorrow morning though!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes, ~g&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The space between ‚Ä¶ the tears we cry is the laughter keeps us coming back for more ‚Ä¶ the space between ‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Dave Matthews Band, ‚ÄúThe Space Between‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I‚Äôve got an idea for a layout for my landing page, seems pretty simple, there‚Äôs already a header, then a ‚Äòbio‚Äô component, and a footer, and I want to have a nav bar that works like tabs and a space for the main content fill up the remaining space, with the whole thing taking up 100% of the vertical space of the screen, so like only that main content part being able to scroll, at least on desktop and tablet.&lt;/p&gt;

        loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what‚Äôs the big deal? Height of the screen is easy, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;100vh&lt;/code&gt;, then just subtract the height of the header, bio component, footer, account for any padding, bada-bing, bada-boom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so fast, cowboy! Maybe there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a simple solution and my CSS skills just aren‚Äôt what they need to be, but googling it pulls up a lot of results for when the heights of the other elements are known or can be easily calculated, and if I‚Äôd rolled all of this myself, I‚Äôd be able to add it up simply, even accounting for changing heights based on font sizes with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;rem&lt;/code&gt; unit, but I used &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gatsby-starter-blog&lt;/code&gt;, which has been great, but like the first h1 tag has &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;font: 106.25%/1.45&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;line-height: 1.15&lt;/code&gt; and ‚Ä¶ wait ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the solution ends up being, I think, that I‚Äôm an idiot and didn‚Äôt see that literally every bit of height, margin, and padding in this whole arrangement &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; based on the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;rem&lt;/code&gt; unit, and like three minutes of trial and error is going to get me were I need to be. I was about to do this whole thing with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;react-sizeme&lt;/code&gt;, which is a library that gives you something like element queries, which isn‚Äôt a thing yet, but because the index page renders the layout component that takes in children as a prop, and only part of that needed to be sized, based on its siblings, but also based on the other components in ‚Äòlayout‚Äô, it was going to be this whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the dumbest smart person I know.‚Äù ‚Äî Dave Crump&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yyyeap, 14.2 was the magic number. Why not 17.825 or 20.65343? Great question. There‚Äôs 3.625rem missing in my calculations somewhere, but now we have new challenges! Yay! Oh, actually, there‚Äôs a whole &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; 3.625rem missing, too. What in the what. Oh wait, no, subtraction, I found the initial 3.625rem, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moving On&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, so there are solutions for having the scrollbar always be visible with the ::-webkit-scrollbar:vertical pseudoelement and pseudoclass ‚Ä¶ &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/stevenlewis/pen/hubpL&quot;&gt;Steven Lewis‚Äô CodePen on it&lt;/a&gt; ‚Ä¶ which we‚Äôre going to leave for now, and revisit when I have more content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, wow, coming along! Wonder how it looks on mobile, lol. Oh, jeez. So the header wraps a line and blows away the math I did, and the -px to the left that I used to create the two key lines sends it right off the screen, but one thing at a time here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oooh, todo: credit &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/overriding-default-button-styles/&quot;&gt;Chris Coyier‚Äôs article&lt;/a&gt; for the button reset. Oh, I‚Äôm doing tabs stupidly, though. I feel like I‚Äôm more in CSS mode, so let me get the styling a little better, then I‚Äôll take Dawa for another walk and come back to JS-land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oof, needs a bit more work, wow though. Can‚Äôt sit anymore though :) //&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boyo, we got a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; one in! I mean, we‚Äôve had longer ones, even recently, but considering being sick, that was ‚Ä¶ how far was that? I use &lt;a href=&quot;mapmyrun.com&quot;&gt;mapmyrun.com&lt;/a&gt; for this type of thing ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so the design thing ‚Ä¶ I think if I can get the major blocks of content squared away, and then handle positioning the content within them to get what I want, that‚Äôs how we‚Äôre going to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indentation? Indentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay brain, vroom vroom. I started with coffee &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; walking Dawa and putting myself together today because it‚Äôs raining and I‚Äôm feeling not-so-great and wasn‚Äôt going to try and handle a coffee cup, umbrella, and dog, but it‚Äôs definitely taking a bit to get going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we‚Äôve got padding on the body ‚Ä¶ oh, &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; put that there. Then the top level div in Layout ‚Ä¶ which is about to get capitalized, I have to make this project feel like mine, you know? And I capitalize component file names. And all exported from an index ‚Ä¶ oh no, apparently no indentation, prettier deletes it on save. \t?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\tIndentation? LOL nope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¬†¬†Indentation? Well, cool, &amp;#x26;nbsp&amp;#x26;nbsp works, destroys my own readability though. First world problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we‚Äôve got the padding left over from the last project that I copy-pasted in, some of which needs to stay because I‚Äôve got the 16px ::before, whiiich I just realized I needed to fix for mobile, where it‚Äôs 12px on top. Alright, blew that away, now we‚Äôve got got the 2.175rem padding on top and bottom and 1.0875rem padding to the left and right, header is a header with an h1 with marginBottom, then a main with no styling, then a footer with no styling. Eugh, so the styling for the Bio component is kind of annoying, what do we have here ‚Ä¶ the wrapper is display flex with a marginBottom of 3.625rem, and then the image wrapper is 50x50 with a marginRight of 0.725rem ‚Ä¶ then typography.js is applying a marginBottom of 1.16rem to img tags, interesting what they‚Äôre doing with the picture element there ‚Ä¶ okay and then the p tag gets marginBottom 1.16rem from typography ‚Ä¶ then it‚Äôs block level and block level for nav and main-content, where I‚Äôm going to want a flex wrapper. I‚Äôd love if I could get that image a little bigger, center align the text to it, push the title and bio back a little to create those key lines ‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs see what we can do with the picture first, because if it‚Äôs too complicated to change that, then we‚Äôve got how many pixels to push, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, gatsby-transformer-sharp is what we learn now ‚Ä¶ whoa. Okay. Crazy. GraphQL coming back, that‚Äôs how you name something, those are arguments, that‚Äôs a fragment ‚Ä¶ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/9882&quot;&gt;which isn‚Äôt available in GraphiQL&lt;/a&gt; ‚Ä¶ yaaay, I did it! Got avatar for blog posts, and bigAvatar for the main page, lol! 96px, then we‚Äôll want, let‚Äôs see ‚Ä¶ can I push things to the left with negative padding and not mess up the margin auto? Not going to lie, layout is not my strong suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bwaa, no, and also I liked having more space at the top ‚Ä¶ aww, sweet, dude! Good ‚Äòole position relative and left -px! Okay, now the next steps are to get the nav and main-content areas squared away, and then I‚Äôm going to rewatch that video from Kevin Powell on designing with pseudoelements ‚Ä¶ jk dog-walking time //&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love how going for a walk is so often the solution when you can‚Äôt solve a problem. I was like, how can I possibly get the nav and main-content area to fill up the remaining space, and on my walk I was like, well durr, you know the heights of the other elements, use calc(100vh - all-that-jazz) and bada-bing, bada-boom. So let‚Äôs see ‚Ä¶ oh, jeez, need to add 16px of left to the main div, too ‚Ä¶ well, 7.25rem to account for the vertical padding on the main layout div ‚Ä¶ oh no, I have no idea why the header is that height. This is why element queries would be dope. Oh, there‚Äôs a library called react-sizeme, this is going to be a pain in the butt ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs okay, let‚Äôs do it. Eugh, so ‚Ä¶ I need the header component to be aware of its size and pass that back up to the state in the index page, as well as the footer, as well as Bio ‚Ä¶ all of this is massively overkill, and I should have just rolled my own typography ‚Ä¶ should‚Äôa, would‚Äôa, could‚Äôa, let‚Äôs get this done. Is this the case for useEffect? //&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahhh! I‚Äôm trying to work, but from being outside for a while and not being able to warm up, and the people yelling outside, and the people yelling upstairs, and the chicken on the stove for Dawa popping and crackling, and the stupidly loud cars in the parking lot, I can‚Äôt concentrate! I‚Äôm tired, and headphones aren‚Äôt going to help. Oh, fuck that dude whose only mode up or down the stairs is ‚Äòrun as clompily as possible.‚Äô I need to follow Meg Lewis‚Äô advice and listen to my brain, and I‚Äôll be more productive later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signing out, and best wishes, ~g&lt;/p&gt;

Get up (before the alarm today! Must have slept!) and make coffee‚Ä¶]]></description><link>https://www.garethfield.com/back-up/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.garethfield.com/back-up/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Mar 2020 10:24:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Good morning! Still not feeling like 100%, but I have routines to lean on. Get up (before the alarm today! Must have slept!) and make coffee, tidy up, walk Dawa, put myself together, work out, eat breakfast, take Dawa for a second walk, make a second cup of coffee, and it‚Äôs coding time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing, changed the title from Gareth Field, Dot Com! to Gareth Field ‚Ä¶ Dot Com! because that sounds more authentically enthusiastic in my head, and changed the base maxWidth of the wrapper div so that it all fit on one line, next up is to fix that one thing about the typography plugin that includes its own color for link underlines, and to remove the anchor tag over the title, and then it‚Äôs time to lay out the main content, and basically I want it to be like a tabs situation on desktop/tablet, and an accordian situation on mobile, and I‚Äôm not going to worry about the menu I was going to put at the top left, all those links can go in the footer, and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; I‚Äôm going to send out some resumes! I have no idea if I‚Äôm good enough, I‚Äôve been doing this for six years now, but I‚Äôve been working and handling life at the same time, but I need to get myself out there (digitally, lol, still under quarantine) and see what happens! So the plan is to get this site to a ‚Äògood enough‚Äô state, apply for some jobs, reach out to my social network, handle some administrative stuff, and work on Run Club afterwards, as a reward. Spencer Carli put out a whole series on react-navigation version 5, so that‚Äôll probably be my starting point to dive back into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs also test block quotes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give me your tired, your
poor, your huddled masses
yearning to breathe free, the
wretched refuse of your
teeming shore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Send these, the homeless,
tempest-tossed to me, I lift
my lamp beside the golden door!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äî Emma Lazarus, 1883&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, interesting, so &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;smartypants&lt;/code&gt; works, though it turns the @ symbol into something obnoxious, and it ignored new lines. Does the pre tag work here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Words
on
multiple
lines ...
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mmm, yea, but how to combine? That‚Äôs not a now problem, that‚Äôs a later problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Give me your tired, your&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;poor, your huddled masses&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;yearning to breathe free, the&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;wretched refuse of your&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;teeming shore.&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt; &lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Send these, the homeless,&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;tempest-tossed to me, I lift&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;my lamp beside the golden door!&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt; &lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;-- Emma Lazarus, 1883&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, now we have a font problem ‚Ä¶ and smartypants didn‚Äôt get the em-dash, either. Le sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layout time. Main objectives: alter ‚Äòbio‚Äô for landing page, set up the nav bar and main areas, make it work on mobile, make the footer content, and populate the main content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweet, okay, bio adjusted, removed the title link on the landing page ‚Ä¶ where to put this blog content? Oh, I‚Äôm going to have to store the current tab somewhere, because hitting back after going to a blog post should return you to the homepage with the coding tab selected and probably scrolled to the right place ‚Ä¶ Ehhh, we‚Äôll get there, let‚Äôs start by just omitting it and getting the area for the nav bar and main content set up on desktop, like, part one stuff here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, so main is just children of layout right now ‚Ä¶ need a nav component ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lol I‚Äôm glad like every keystroke and error message aren‚Äôt recorded ‚Ä¶ as I totally forget how to author and use components for a split sec ‚Ä¶ //&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, dog walked again, ready to tackle this nav thing. Just going to write the desktop version for the moment. Nav takes up a space, main takes up a space, main renders content based on what nav item is selected. &lt;del&gt;How hard could it&lt;/del&gt; hOw HaRd CoUlD iT bE?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lol, it‚Äôd be much easier without the local tweaker wandering back and forth in front of my apartment barking swearwords. But for the grace of God goes I, I suppose though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successfully extracted the BlogList into it‚Äôs own component! I know I kinda asked for it by choosing gatsby-starter-blog, but I‚Äôm at the point where I can look at how data is flowing through this thing and make changes. Alright, why is my dummy nav component rendering first here, though? Mmm, okay, after header, before children, but on the landing page, bio is part of children. So nav should be part of index? Yyy ‚Ä¶ yes. Maybe? This is where I need to use pen and paper for a sanity check ‚Ä¶ no, I can think through this, I only need the nav component on the index page, the layout is included as part of the index page, and also the blog posts, but the blog posts are created as pages because of gatsby-node and the template file, so anything special I‚Äôd want to change about the blog posts, except for the bio which is aware of location, I‚Äôd change in the template file and possibly ‚Ä¶ pass in ‚Ä¶ no, it gets its own pageQuery, because its (they‚Äôre) a page (pages,) and then anything special I‚Äôd want to change about the index page I change in /pages/index, which is the only place I want Nav, right? For the moment? And then how about main, because in layout, main contains children ‚Ä¶ of ‚Ä¶ of page, except layout ‚Ä¶ nav is child of layout in main ‚Ä¶ &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; children on layout in main are affected by nav ‚Ä¶ omg shoot me, yea, pen and paper diagramming time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweeeeet, figured out images in blog posts, too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so, section, article, or div? I remember listening to a JavaScript Jabber episode with the semantic HTML guy and he said to like never use one of those two, article or section ‚Ä¶ section? Okay, are the elements semantically related, no, use div, got it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh man, need state, reaching for hooks! I‚Äôm so modern, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LOL oh no, I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing. Efffff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, J/K, I just needed to refresh the page. Silly me. Yay I get hooks! Sort of! We‚Äôre passing functions, we‚Äôre doing all that stuff, yeah! My legs are falling asleep! //&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely still sick, acutally took a nap there. I like &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; take a nap, and I know like people are dying, so big whoop, but like I‚Äôm about as healthy as someone could expect to be ‚Ä¶ anyway, I‚Äôve got a moment here, must press on. Definitely not applying for jobs today ‚Ä¶ I always think I can get so much more done in a day! Wtf, me?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so right now we‚Äôve got just a div with maxWidth set, marginLeft and marginRight auto, and padding. So let‚Äôs see, we want height to be 100vh and overflow hidden, and then the mainContent div will be scrollable, and somehow we‚Äôve got to establish first and second key lines for horizontal rhythm, with the title, avatar, and tab icons aligned to the first key line, and the blurb and tab titles aligned to the second, with content following. And my dog wants to be fed. So at least we got that far, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oof, so, got some conditional rendering going with an IIFE, because I like that inline style, dog is fed, dog wants another walk, check out &lt;a href=&quot;youtube.com/healthcaretriage&quot;&gt;Healthcare Triage&lt;/a&gt; for the latest on coronavirus Covid-19, stay safe out there, I‚Äôm going to call it, pretty productive day, maybe could have done a little better, what a time though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes, ~g&lt;/p&gt;

Just jumped through every hoop to try and get tested, and at least got a doctor‚Äôs note to quarantine for two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So like, eugh, I‚Äôm sick, hopefully things aren‚Äôt going to get worse, but also like, ayy, it‚Äôs ‚Äúget a new job‚Äù time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And given how my current boss has handled this, it‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; ‚Äúget a new job‚Äù time. Goodness ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as the coffee kicks in, I‚Äôve got to get my bearings here. Oh yea, let‚Äôs see if the Google Analytics thing got any hits! ‚Ä¶ and we wait, lol ‚Ä¶ I thought I‚Äôd be slick with it and just use my phone‚Äôs unlimited data plan and good connection around here for my Internet, but it turns out there‚Äôs a cap on high-speed data as a hotspot ‚Ä¶ Hmm, didn‚Äôt seem to record anything. Maybe I‚Äôll have my sister Elsbeth go to it a few times, if she has time. They‚Äôre self-isolating, too. Crazy right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, vroom-vroom, let‚Äôs do this thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so there‚Äôs more under-the-hood things going on with images and stuff, I‚Äôd really like to get the main appearance of this thing a little closer to what I had with the create-react-app version, and ideally somewhat further along with that, because more than I need this to do all of the really interesting stuff I‚Äôm looking forward to doing with it, I need it to look presentable so I can start sending resumes out, like today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The typography package, though, let me just look into how rhythm works ‚Ä¶ oh, okay, that‚Äôs a function of line height, I saw like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;rhythm(3 / 4)&lt;/code&gt; and thought we were doing something super fancy. I mean it‚Äôs fancy, but ‚Ä¶ got it, okay, keep moving. Definitely lost a minute looking at different typography themes and am definitely going to go with a different one than the project comes with ‚Ä¶ to the future though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, orientation ‚Ä¶ /pages, top level is /pages ‚Ä¶ index ‚Ä¶ and here we‚Äôve got a component that‚Äôs the default export called BlogIndex, and because we‚Äôre also exporting a const pageQuery which is a Gatsby graphql query, we get a ({ data }) prop, and I‚Äôm not exactly sure where ({ location }) is coming from, but we‚Äôve got that too ‚Ä¶ let me log that ‚Ä¶ hmm, wonder what ‚Äòstate‚Äô is there? Got it though, pathname, hostname, url, all that jazz. Oh, also I wonder what prism.css is, just checked out the imports in gatsby-browser ‚Ä¶ oh a syntax highlighter! Oh, I‚Äôll have to use this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, then we‚Äôve got the Layout component, taking in location and siteTitle, pulled from data.site.siteMetadata, then an SEO component, then a ‚ÄòBio‚Äô component, then a map of posts to article tags with all sorts of good stuff in there. I don‚Äôt see any media queries on Bio, how resonsive is this? Hmm, okay, works with simple content ‚Ä¶ and okay, so the blog-post template also uses Layout ‚Ä¶ and so basically I want to retain that layout for blog content and pages like ‚Äòcredits‚Äô for the icons I‚Äôm going to &lt;del&gt;steal&lt;/del&gt; use from the wonderful folk involved in the Noun Project, but I want something custom for the landing page ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, interesting, so Layout gets location, title (siteTitle), and children, and switches what the header is based on whether the path is / or not. Oh, okay, so we‚Äôve got h1s and h3s going on, and the h1 on the landing page is scaled up by 1.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, &lt;em&gt;that‚Äôs&lt;/em&gt; how to use styled components, with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gatsby-plugin-styled-components&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;import styled from &amp;#39;styled-components&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt; ‚Ä¶ how do I use Prism for better syntax highlighting? So much exciting stuff to learn here!! First styled-components, and reorganizing the utils folder, pulling in my own stuff, injecting a global styles to get my fancy body{ &amp;#x26;::before { going ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh YAAAYYY!!! I know it‚Äôs a split for everyone, how they write styles, but I‚Äôve been using styled-components for years, it‚Äôs how I do :) //&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okeeday, dog walked again, dishes done and ready to cook dinner, but let me keep going on this. SO happy that I could just bring over the global styles from the other project, colors and breakpoints up and running, I feel like we‚Äôre rocking and rolling here. Oh the before pseudo-element doesn‚Äôt work the same now the window can be scrolled ‚Ä¶ hmm ‚Ä¶ ohh, fixed it immediately, let‚Äôs hear it for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;position: fixed&lt;/code&gt; ‚Ä¶ but let‚Äôs then hear it for some different typography, because the line height for paragraphs is way to small, and the font for headers is goofy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohhkay, well I changed the theme and the fonts, and I like that links are underlined, because that‚Äôs accessible, but the main header h1 needs to not be a link, and the colors need to be on brand, and also I haven‚Äôt changed up like the main layout of the page yet, but we‚Äôre getting there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTW the GitHub mobile app just dropped! Whaaat!! I think I‚Äôm done for the night, though, unless I get a magical burst of energy later, still sick and feeling it, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes! ~g&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. Okay, I lied a little, opened everything up after walking Dawa again and feeding him, and the underline color for links is achieved with backgroundImage! Weird! I kinda want to just fork the theme and customize it that way, but that‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; a morning task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm switching the whole site over to Gatsby rather than just a part of it, using gatsby-starter-blog, and so I‚Äôm going to go through this plugin by plugin and see what‚Äôs up here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with gatsby-plugin-google-analytics! Sweet! Learned I was still a part of the Fastblr analytics account, lol! That was a blog I got paid to write for a few years ago, didn‚Äôt really go anywhere, but hey, I can say I‚Äôve been paid to write! Okay, account created for this site, tracking ID plugged in, and I followed the instructions on &lt;a href=&quot;https://neilpatel.com/blog/protect-analytics-from-hacking/&quot;&gt;Neil Patel‚Äôs site&lt;/a&gt; to protect the traffic data from being corrupted. Thanks Neil!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs see if I can launch the thing and record a hit ‚Ä¶ //&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lol, well, launch, check, today we learned Google Analytics is not realtime though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just tightened the bolts in this desk, omg, so much better. It was rattling as I typed, that was driving me crazy. Okay, page launched, dog walked, desk tightened, does /bounce still work? What‚Äôs that called? Asking Reactiflux ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúserver routing‚Äù or ‚Äúserving static files,‚Äù so maybe I can say that ‚Ä¶ well I mean, Gatsby is still rendering routes statically, but I‚Äôm using server routing to render the /bounce route with just a set of html, css, and javascript files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yay it still works! This is the silliest thing, but I made a page that spawns a random-ish number of red balls that bounce around on a blue background in random-ish directions at random-ish speeds, and it‚Äôs definitely not the most advanced thing in the world, lol, but I made it so long ago, and was so proud of myself for working through the problems and getting it to work that going to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.garethfield.com/bounce&quot;&gt;garethfield.com/bounce&lt;/a&gt; has always been a comfort, though it‚Äôs like one pixel off to the right and bottom so it scrolls just a little, frantically, lol, but that‚Äôs a thing to fix at a later time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, next up, gatsby-plugin-react-helmet, and here I‚Äôm going to have to dig into a few things, because I get what Helmet generally does, it adds meta info and all that jazz, but looking at the SEO component, I‚Äôm going to have to look up the useStaticQuery function at least. I think I remember this being part of the new hotness that Gatsby is allowing for around having some of your content be dynamically generated, let‚Äôs see if I‚Äôm right. Sweet, right on, used to have PageQuery that took in context and could only be called at the page level and StaticQuery that took in no context but could be called on any component, and now we‚Äôve got the useStaticQuery hook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought hooks were going to be crazy hard to learn, I think taking a step back into plain javascript land for a bit did me a load of good. Yay for &lt;a href=&quot;beginnerjavascript.com&quot;&gt;Wes Bos‚Äô Beginner JavaScript course!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so instead of using the Helmet component directly, there‚Äôs an SEO component that takes in a title (required,) and optionally a description, lang, and array of metas, and adds a bunch by default from the site data ‚Ä¶ where does that live again? It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve really worked on a Gatsby site, like the Bruckner Oncology project :( gatsby-config, right. I wonder if I should ‚Ä¶ yes, lol, the answer is yes, I should make a Twitter account again. I will take a deep breath before tweeting this time around, I promise, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ooo, that‚Äôs one sleek form, Twitter. Also, I am &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; used to verification by sms at this point. That was one of the coolest things we got working at the AWS meetup around Amplify and MobileHub and all that jazz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright beezleys, it‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;twitter.com/barefootgareth&quot;&gt;@barefootgareth&lt;/a&gt; to y‚Äôall!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, so easily distracted ‚Ä¶ took off on a js package managers journey because Microsoft just bought NPM (‚Ä¶eep,) and then a little journey on Chakra UI, which looks dope and has a Gatsby plugin! Where were we though, metadata, metadata ‚Ä¶ Okay, definitely at a concentration limit, time for a groceries run and another walk for Dawa! // (btw, for whatever reason in my notes, I tend to leave a ‚Äô//‚Äô where I leave off for a while, and a ‚Äô///‚Äô for like a major break, like next day or later usually. Looking forward to getting my paper notes scanned!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whooooops, broke production! First of many, most likely, let‚Äôs dig in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eugh, so weird, I rebuilt it and pushed index.html over, and it works, but none of the newer blog content is there and the profile image is super wonky. I also am losing steam a little, and maybe should switch tasks so I stay interested, because honestly ‚Ä¶ I really love this stuff because it‚Äôs so cool writing code and talking with the machine and making something awesome for people, and I really need to work hard at it because there‚Äôs a lot of surface area, and frankly I‚Äôm not that smart, and it‚Äôs my best shot at not cleaning toilets the rest of my life ‚Ä¶ ahhh, I think the back pain is taking over the conversation at this point :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, let me just see if replacing everything gatsby-related has the site still working, so I know I‚Äôm not going crazy at least and can start from relatively fresh, though! I must say, I changed my GitHub password because I had a login from France on a different service and probably don‚Äôt have the best password security, and then my git stuff broke earlier, and I was reminded very quickly how much I don‚Äôt really know about git and ssh and credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or how much I have to learn! Got to stay positive! Got to call it, after this, too, I‚Äôm going to get Dawa‚Äôs dinner going, fetch the laundry, and try and get a good night‚Äôs sleep, and hopefully I don‚Äôt have the plague, here (search for the news on this date, lol. I called out tomorrow because I have a bit of a throat/upper respiratory/lower GI thing going on and don‚Äôt want to risk it-slash-need a mental health day after yesterday‚Äôs shift, holy moley ‚Ä¶) So!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes! ~g&lt;/p&gt;
