Good morning! Today's first challenge is refactoring the socials icons, because it works on my machine, but not in production, and I looked at the original code and it was super complicated for no reason, and it's such a distraction, especially because garethfield.com/virtual-garage-sale/ isn't being served statically so I can't link to it? Or something? That's a big todo, but it's still early and the social icons looking like this is really bugging me, like, I need to take a screenshot, it really does look nice when `dev` is running.

Hoof, okay, well, we'll see if it works in production, it's much simpler now though. Time to test out the new update flow, too.

YES! Okay, we're flying here, I fixed the socials thing, the upload went well, I fixed the carousel, the progress bar, the pricetag, the price string logic, the category buttons, category headers, ... that might have been it ... oh, color for sold items ... there's a bunch more to do but if I don't move my body, my spine is going to entirely rebel! To the future!

/// I ran Dawa to Fort Trumbull in the stroller, then around the park and then back with him again in the stroller. Ow. Must keep moving though. There's lots about the site that needs work, signing off for now though. Best wishes. ~g
