Good morning! Today's first challenge is refactoring the socials icons, because it works on my machine, but not in production, and I looked at the original code and it was super complicated for no reason, and it's such a distraction, especially because garethfield.com/virtual-garage-sale/ isn't being served statically so I can't link to it? Or something? That's a big todo, but it's still early and the social icons looking like this is really bugging me, like, I need to take a screenshot, it really does look nice when `dev` is running.

Hoof, okay, well, we'll see if it works in production, it's much simpler now though. Time to test out the new update flow, too.

Stay tuned if you're reading this! :)
