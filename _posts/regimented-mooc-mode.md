Good morning! I was up a little late today, like 6, but Dawa had a first walk, significant grooming, and a two mile run, and I got a NASM-style workout in beforehand, and I'm able to work outside it's so warm, which a little unsettling, not gonna lie.

Lol, there's some construction thing going on like five, six doors down, and they must be using a nail gun?

I've got a timer going to switch back and forth to/from standing desk mode, so ... oh, em, gee ... at least _I'm_ not the person with a car that loud, imagine anywhere you went that was what you were in? Good lord. Okay. I was going to so some photograph naming ... I can at least put them into sets, hold on ... okay, standing mode go ... I'm going ... so are the construction workers ... so's the storm rolling in? I think it's time to head to the store before it becomes too much of a mission, getting there and back in rain is less fun than one might imagine. // I kept working, and my back hurts. Silly goose. Move.
