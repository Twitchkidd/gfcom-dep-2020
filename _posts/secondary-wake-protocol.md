Good morning! Up early today! 3:35! I was thinking I could maybe get some more rest in or I could get up, when Dawa walks up to me, shakes himself out, and sits and looks at me. There is no mistaking that signal, it was time for _secondary wake protocol,_ where it goes, "Dog," then everything else. Hence the name. You want creativity, follow a designer, lol. I've got more of a 'boop bop beep' aesthetic at the moment.

Time to finish this CV! Work experience, sure, education, eh, always have to explain the no degree thing somehow, other work, that was amusing, self study ... how exactly do I bill for the countless hours of reading articles, following tutorials, pouring over documentation, going to StackOverflow to try to figure things out ... ahhrgh. Oh well, got a good list. Then volunteer work, skills, and interests. Sure, can do. I'm going to get the coffee I made, first, and try to get into the swing of it.

Whoops, got distracted helping someone on Discord. Did it, though, we solved it! [If you need to decode strings that contain html entities read this SO answer.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57480647)

Ahem. Well, mentoring in Reactiflux, onto the CV we go!

Except one thing, where the _heckin_ did I write ... **HeroPost** that's where it's from. Thank goodness for project-wide search, I thought I was going nuts. Oh, _that's_ where I wrote about it, Twitter! I was like, where did I blog about this?! I didn't, though, I Tweeted. Yeesh. Too much, sometimes, you know?

CV!

Oh, you know what I almost didn't even mention? That I've run linux servers on various platforms, and set up Nginx and all that. I think maybe my brain was just trying to protect itself and forget.

Oooo I did it, did it did iiit YEA! I'm going to pick a cover image for this and post it up to the interwebs ... `goodVibes++`
