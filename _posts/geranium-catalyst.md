Good morning! Today is going to be _fueled!_ Slept well, _been_ sleeping okay, up early, routine in full swing, and the place is a _mess!_ And so's my code!

Yay!

No really, though, I need motivation right now, and a mess gets me motivated, and that's the only way to make big changes, anyway, make a mess and have at it. The place being a mess I'll not bore us with the details of, but I've got to talk through making an un-mess out of my code.

Okay, so I know where I'm at with the thing at least responding helpfully to hitting the url, and so the page file needs fleshing out, but the next two steps are to go back to my notes to pick out exactly what the targets were, and then the file in lib/ needs fleshing out to pick those targets and pass them in as props on build. I wish I could work on this more right now, but my dog needs more attention. To the future.
