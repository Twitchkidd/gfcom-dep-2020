Good morning! Definite Autumn vibes today!

Ohh, two things going on right now, I've got the logic for splitting mobile and desktop modes in my pasteboard, layout, appwrap, tabs, morelessbutton are shared, modal is not, let's just start here so the code lights back up, lol.

Yaaay it formatted! Always a good feeling! Just needed a fragment, no biggie.
Why no grid, website?

### Mobile mode:

#### Grid elements

- AppWrap (check, though whether the grid defined is correct, who knows)
- Header1 (is a flex item in desktop mode!)
- Nav (is a flex item in desktop mode!) (putting it under mainoverlay!)
- MainOverlay
- MainWrap

#### Absolutely positioned

- MoreLessButton
- Modal

#### Relative positioned check

-

### Desktop mode:

#### Grid elements

- AppWrap (check, though whether the grid defined is correct, who knows)
- Sidebar
- Header2 (is a flex item in mobile mode!)
- MainOverlay
- MainWrap

#### Absolutely positioned

- MoreLessButton

#### Relative positioned check
