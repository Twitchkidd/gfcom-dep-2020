Good morning! Today we learned:

`f"Hey I'm an f-string! {variable}"`
`"Hey I'm an f-string! {}".format(variable)`
`"Hey I'm an f-string! {1}".format(otherVariable, variable)`
`"Hey I'm an f-string! {var}".format(oth=otherVariable, var=variable)`

and:

`myList = [1, 3, 3, 5]`
`mySet = set(myList)`
`print(mySet)`
`# -> {1, 3, 5}`

and that logger has a .exception that's been just waiting for me to discover it, lol.
