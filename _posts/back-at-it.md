Good morning!

So I took two days off from coding, and made a nine-week plan for various aspects of my life on Saturday, and took a day yesterday to be a no-screens day, and now I'm refreshed and ready to go! Relatively refreshed, at least, the saga with tweaker-man continues and like ... those were two days I didn't get any work-work done and that's a little stressful to think about, but I really think I needed it.

Today, I'm going through what I need to get done on the back end for the Run Club project to be done enough so that the next step is the front end refactor, then I'm going to update my resume and write a cover letter, and aggregate more places to apply. Next up is handling the front end of this website, because it's not exactly a great selling point for me as a dev, and then I'll be in front end mode when I come back to Run Club, and I'll feel better about sending out stronger applications.

So, the landing page as authed/non-authed is a todo, more runner info and deleting one's account, updating the run page with chat, the runs listing page needs data to come back sorted for a map and table, the buds list needs more info and chat, and runner pages in general, and the my runs page needs data coming in sorted for a map and table, too. Aaand go! //

Alright, landing page for authed/non-authed, handled, more or less, on to getting the profile filled out. I have to make a decision on how I'm going to do this, actually, but first I have to get myself together, get a workout in, and walk Dawa again. C'est la vie avec un chiene, lol! //

Eugh, the amount that I did _not_ want to do that workout, lol. Got a plan though, and I'm sticking to it! Okay, made some lunch, made some coffee (first French press of the Ethiopia Sidama my sister gave me! Omg! It's like ... okay, possible NSFW here, but it's like a tangerine ... no, nevermind. It's quite good!) ... and code time! //

Oh, boy, that was an adventure. Updated the info that's on the user account, and added some super-super-super ugly logic for whether it's the first time they're going to the edit account (profile) page ... but it works, and it's time to walk Dawa again! üê∂ Next up is chat! Oh boy, lol. Doesn't look too bad he said?
