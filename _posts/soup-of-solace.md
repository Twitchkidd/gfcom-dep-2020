Good afternoon! Been a few days, please pardon, I've been getting myself together. Yesterday I even pretty much just threw the whole day and did an epic endurance mission in the morning and then pretty much pulled the plug and didn't do anything but walk Dawa one more time, and rested. I haven't really caught up on rest in a while, what a sensation! Highly recommend!

So, I didn't get the job I was hoping to get, and am ever so slightly devestated. (I mean really, I'm okay, I've got a really solid routine and don't usually suffer from depression like I used to.) Before I move on, though, I wanted to do a bit of a review and write down some things I learned, and what I think my next moves should be.

#### Lessons Learned

1. Oh yes I \*would\* learn Java for the right job!

This company reached out to me because they're recruiters filling a gap in the market between Salesforce adoption and the admin/developer jobs created along with that, their pitch being that they'll pay for a ten-week training period and two certifications and you'd work for them for two years, and I had the right sort of stuff on my resume to get noticed, and was super excited, even though the language I'd be using for work would be the Salesforce proprietary language APEX which is apparently "like 60% similar to Java"?

Looking back on _that_ aspect, I may have dodged a bullet, but I **totally** would have learned -whatever- and coded in -whatever-, I had the Java docs open when I got the rejection call, I was ready to **go!** I think I had this notion that I wouldn't do Java or whatever else because I have my stack that I like to work with right now, but nnnope, not so. I've got a new appreciation for broadening my horizons with tech just because I know I can do it now and also because you never know what opportunity might turn up!

2. Rejection **phone calls!**

I've had a few interviews lately that have been after the initial screening process and a call, and, between the companies that sent a rejection email and the company whose rep called back to tell me in person and talk for a minute, the difference in lasting impression is stark. Company rule #1: No rejection emails. (Once there's been a phone/video call.)

If anyone out there is a dev with 3-5 years experience, maybe knows Java, I had a great experience with Revolent Group, definitely look them up.

3. Years of 'commercial experience': bleurgh.

I ranked third on the technical test, but the other people apparently have 3-5 years working in tech, and I've got just a year in cumulative time, though I've been coding for six years overall, as well as being friendly, outgoing, and polite, to toot my own horn for a moment, but it looks like that's one of the big metrics people are looking at, so I'd better address it. Right now I'm leaning towards getting a temporary job and trying to get some freelance work, while still applying to dev jobs too, so that I can at the very least be working, putting more time in on the tech resume, and keeping on trying, and you never know.

#### Main Takeaway

The thing that's really different is I got so close I could taste it and now I'm hungry for a job in tech, and after having convinced (or tried to convince) a few people that I can do the clickety-clack, I actually am beginning to believe it myself. I'm pretty sure I can actually _do_ the clickety-clack, like legit I was going to learn _Java!_ I just need to keep getting better at the clickety-clack, and get better at convincing people that I can do the clickety-clack, as well.

Clickety-clack = programming, lol.

Alright, well there's no code being written today, I did my planning for the week today, listed the computers, I'm doing rounds of laundry and I have other things to do this evening, so I think until tomorrow, best wishes! ~g
