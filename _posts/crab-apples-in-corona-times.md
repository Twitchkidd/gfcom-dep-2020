Good, ah, missed it, 12:10pm, good afternoon though!

So I think if I can just get _something_ up that I can link to in listings, and then it's just focusing on process, list an item, update the site, make a listing, make an upgrade, go until items = 0 and the website is cool enough to share.

Late start today because I biked Dawa to Harkness and ran with him there, biked back, and saw my sister and fam for a bit! Back to work though!

/// From the future! : Sold the other Windows machine yesterday! Yay! Back pain wiped me out for a lot of yesterday though, boo. I got a great night's sleep though, so yay! To ... the present! Best wishes, ~g!
