Good morning! If you already know about this, you think I'm a troglodyte, but if you don't, go to Google Calendar on your laptop/desktop ... and hit the number keys.

Oh ... my ... goodness. I feel like The Doctor, and can not just see but touch the space-time continuum.

Ahem. Anyway. Images. Drove myself approximately nutso by having my images in no less than **nine** different places for this project. Still working on it, but there's hypothetically three places that the VGS photos should go now, Drive/VGS/highRes, Drive/VGS, and gfcom/public/VGS. There's also a Drive/VGS/notYet for some already optimized images I'm not using, so the gfcom/public/VGS can be just a mirror of Drive/VGS, and the photos of non-processed items are still scattered across my phone and the other four random folders they ended up in somehow.

> As my friend Dave said, "Gareth, you're the dumbest smart person I know."

// Much later, Dawa got ran, got some work done at the Arboretum, almost makes up for the pizza someone got for me last night, and just about done with the deets for the next set of posts for the VGS. Tomorrow morining should finish that saga up until it begins again ... good lord. It can only take less time after this, and super stoked about what I'm working on after that. Hang in, y'all, and best wishes! ~g
