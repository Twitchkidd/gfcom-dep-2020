The Oswegatchie Hills are amazing, please pardon the word play for the post title!

Today was Sunday, and also Mother's Day, and I avoided knowing that fact until late afternoon.

The good news is that I realized I totally leveled up as a systems admin, unix user, and node developer, got to the trail, the puppy is happy, and I have any supplies I need for the moment.

Best wishes,
