Good morning!

What's been happening? I didn't get to posting for a few days. Still going with posting to eBay etc.! AHH! It's okay, it's like 80% of the way there ... for the first 30% of the stuff. Bleh, my initial guesses for values of things are looking way off. Could be depressing, we've got to remember stress vs. strain, though. Keep on rocking and rolling!

Then yesterday, Patrick and I had another great tutoring session, and we're working on his personal website for getting DJing bookings, which is inspiring more interest than the previous sample project. Hoping for another sesh later! Go Pat go!

I dove back into the MOOC this morning, after sleeping **WAY** in! Part two is off to a good start, finished up the recap section after leaving it like a week ago because I got annoyed at it, lol, and I got through the whole HashMap section, which I feel like I have a good understanding of.

It's raining here, and is supposed to let up in a few hours. Time to put myself together, I think, it's been that kind of day so far. Dawa was so good! We went out, sniffed around for a minute, relieved ourselves, then headed right back in! Ooo, and he got (most of, lol) a haircut a few days ago! Oh, yea, that was part of why daily posts paused again, lord that day was stressful.

Okay, I'd love to keep going right now, but if I keep sitting I'm going to explode. Cya later blog post! //
