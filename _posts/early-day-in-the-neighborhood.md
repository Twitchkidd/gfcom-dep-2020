Been rocking and rolling for a while here, in case I forget though, running into >64000 files in a dex, trying changing the minSdkVersion to 21 as per [https://developer.android.com/studio/build/multidex](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/multidex)

I need to pull the plug on this until I get Internet and/or my physical device back, I can't seem to connect to the Internet from the emulator. Back to iOS!

I've gotten so much done today so far! Must keep going! Up since 5:30 and got the BusinessSelection screen wired up, context doing its thing ... oof, just spent three hours trying to get the Android emulator to connect. Brutal.

> Again I saw that under the sun the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor riches to the intelligent, nor favor to the skillfull; but time and chance happen to them all. -- Eccesiates 9:11

Best wishes! ~g
