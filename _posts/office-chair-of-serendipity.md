Good morning! And here's to good back health! Someone was tossing out an office chair because the leather is going a bit, and I was out with Dawa at 5:30am, so guess who's got a real office chair now! Honestly when I was deciding on how to level up my development game here, I almost bought a nice chair instead of a nice computer. I think I made the right choice though, knocking on wood, the early-2020 MacBook Pro has been super solid.

Anyway, I was able to sit comfortably for like 45 minutes before I switched to the hard chair with the orthotic seat, and I finished the first module of Salesforce training! Seems legit, basically it's an app for all your business stuff. Very exciting! Well, very _not_ exciting, but it's exciting how _not exciting_ it is! "Ah, yes, the business stuff, yes, we can do that, for a price of five moneys. Four moneys? Okay, well, just for you, here's one business thing, and I'll have those four moneys please, good doing business fellow business-person!" I can do this for a few years.

Big knock on wood though, as I don't actually **have** the job yet, lol.

Other things I'm doing today, if I could please for the love of all that is Holy finish the bloody Craigslist posts, Dawa is going to want for a bike ride here, the bathroom needs cleaning, then if I could my site not total garbage on mobile and fix the virtual-garage-sale page ... that would about do me for the day then. Oh, photo scanning, there's always that. Aaand go!

Oh, no post from yesterday, right! I took the (first?) coding challenge for the job yesterday, and it was (know on wood) super easy! Enough that I'm a little worried, lol. Like, am I tripping and actually got every question wrong? Am I selling myself super short? What's happening?

Yesterday was also a big cooking day! I figured out SNAP benefits, and I've got rice, beans, a soup that'll cure what ails you, and Dawa's dinner for tonight all ready, and the kitchen is mostly clean! It's a beautiful thing, and honestly being stuck in this apartment with Dawa, having the place clean and tidy is the only way work gets done.

Much excitement! To the future!
