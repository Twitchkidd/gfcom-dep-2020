Good morning! And here's to good back health! Someone was tossing out an office chair because the leather is going a bit, and I was out with Dawa at 5:30am, so guess who's got a real office chair now! Honestly when I was deciding on how to level up my development game here, I almost bought a nice chair instead of a nice computer. I think I made the right choice though, knocking on wood, the early-2020 MacBook Pro has been super solid.

Anyway, I was able to sit comfortably for like 45 minutes before I switched to the hard chair with the orthotic seat, and I finished the first module of Salesforce training! Seems legit, basically it's an app for all your business stuff. Very exciting! Well, very _not_ exciting, but it's exciting how _not exciting_ it is! "Ah, yes, the business stuff, yes, we can do that, for a price of five moneys. Four moneys? Okay, well, just for you, here's one business thing, and I'll have those four moneys please, good doing business fellow business-person!" I can do this for a few years.

Big knock on wood though, as I don't actually **have** the job yet, lol.

Other things I'm doing today, if I could please for the love of all that is Holy finish the bloody Craigslist posts, Dawa is going to want for a bike ride here, the bathroom needs cleaning, then if I could my site not total garbage on mobile and fix the virtual-garage-sale page ... that would about do me for the day then. Oh, photo scanning, there's always that. Aaand go!

Oh, no post from yesterday, right! I took the (first?) coding challenge for the job yesterday, and it was (know on wood) super easy! Enough that I'm a little worried, lol. Like, am I tripping and actually got every question wrong? Am I selling myself super short? What's happening?

Yesterday was also a big cooking day! I figured out SNAP benefits, and I've got rice, beans, a soup that'll cure what ails you, and Dawa's dinner for tonight all ready, and the kitchen is mostly clean! It's a beautiful thing, and honestly being stuck in this apartment with Dawa, having the place clean and tidy is the only way work gets done.

Much excitement! To the future!

// Alrighty, from the future! I got Dawa out on a bike ride, we cut it short and just went behind the woods across the way and walked back, my Achilles is really feelin' it today. Then I went back out to get the trailer, then we went for another walk when I got the trailer and bike upstairs ... **should be good for a bit,** lol

Ohhh, that's nice, I thought just maybe if I tried https://garethfield.com/virtual-garage-sale.html rather than just https://garethfield.com/virtual-garage-sale if might work ... it did! Yay!
Now I'm going to post the link to it at the bottom of my posts, and it'll be good motivation to fix it :)
