Good morning! It got bright and hot out quick this morning! Up nice and early, Dawa and I had substantial hanging out at the dog park time, and I got yesterday's post pushed, while out on the patio, but then my laptop became a very small bucket of lava, so we moved inside where it can at least not have to use power for the screen, as there's the dedicated work-space one. Looking forward to slightly cooler temperatures, not going to lie.

I guess the polar bears, too.

Anyway, on to programming :(

I just said on Twitter that I'd have my site pushed to Next by 3! WtF, PAST ME?! Why did you do that? TF!!! üò† üê° üòÖ

Alright, let's try running it, then, where were we?

QotD isn't defined, needs to take in quote and attribution ... thanks to [html5doctor.com](https://html5doctor.com/blockquote-q-cite/) for the article about that, made good semantic choices with the quote of the day ‚úÖ üìú

DelightButton ... honestly I thought I got to that one, maybe that was the last thing I was going to do yesterday before I couldn't sit and look at a screen anymore, lol.

Btw, I'd love to get these posts divided up into weeks, I feel like going back to March I'd be more likely to have a good picture for any given week rather than for each almost-daily post, and then by month, and not the least reason is that, while this is soon to be fixed, I have two directories of posts right now because of the two builds, and when they're both open my brain wants to explode. The automater post-creator and the whole UI for months/weeks can wait until after launch, though, so close! Go!

MoreLessShadowElement ... NavIndicator ... NavIndicatorText ... of course allposts isn't defined, it's allPosts with a capital P ... useTabState ... hmmm ... TabLinks ...
