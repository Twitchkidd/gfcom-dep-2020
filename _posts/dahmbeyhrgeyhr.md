Good morning! It's beautiful out today! Let's jump right into finally getting these tabs all styled up! Pen and paper first, I think, to get my head into it.

Helps me think, and is fun to do :) ![Pen and paper UI planning](/its-a-plan-stan.jpg)

Okay, change justify content ... or just remove, because the default is `flex-start` ...

// Oh, I just did so much and didn't write any of it down! Whooooops! I'll leave a little easter egg by making a commit called 'easter' ... look at the console and click the hamburger :)

Okay, dog-walking time, made a lot of progress, will be definitely happy when I've gotten toggling the menu to render a menu, throwing some actual content in the main panels, and then there's an accordian example in the tabs repo, so mobile optimization next! I should save that for tomorrow though, and end today on being happier with the desktop version. Oh, just found a bug where the scale thing means if you click within 10% of the edge it doesn't register an event ... maybe I scale to 110? No, that looks awful, 0.95 then.
