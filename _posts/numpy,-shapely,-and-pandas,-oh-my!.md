Good morning blog! Sorry I was gone for a while! I'm going to do better about writing every day, I think it's good for me.

### Did you die?

Nope, didn't, just busy!

### Oh. What now?

Well, coding-wise, I'm still taking the MOOC, and I think I'm just about up to the end of part 1, and then there's a backlog of projects and things to be researching, looming, lol, which just tells me that I really need to organize that part of my life, but so okay **last night** I'm on Reddit, and someone posted this pattern generator made with Python, and I started down some rabbit holes that I really want to keep going down because it was so interesting.

### How about life outside of code?

Ahhh!!! Eh, I mean, definitely an amount of 'ahh,' I don't know if three exclamation points was a little over the top, my bad.

Haven't heard back from the Moodbit folk, though that's not a silver bullet, and I really need to make a major push career-wise, so that's one, and then my apartment is ... well, it took a lot of organizing for it to be usable, and I'm about to get _another_ load of stuff up from Long Island. Hopefully I can reach the person who was going to buy all the tools, that would free up some space, and putting things on eBay/Craigslist is taking _forever,_ but I've got a system and there's another round just about ready.

Oh, then the photos, right, **almost forgot** that a few days ago was a year since Mom's passing.

### Still there?

Ahem, yes, spaced out for a while, where were we?

It's raining, Dawa is definitely not getting a walk for a little, unless he gets up and actively begs to be taken out, because we were out at 2:30am. And saw Keith! Go Keith, go! And Sugar, of course. Sugar is Keith's ... is Keith's mother's dog that he takes care of a lot? His dog? More Keith's than anyone else who takes Sug to the park here, which consists of the set of people: Keith ...

Uhhh, woof, must try to focus. It's nice just free-writing and typing English for a while, though. Writing code [TODO FIND LINK] _does_ use the same parts of the brain as writing natural language, and I know there are some people out there who can really fly on the keyboard, definitely not there yet though. Eh, I'm still learning different languages, my editor is only kinda half set up, only have one package published to PyPi, embrace the beginner-ness, my friend, keep learning!

( The song reached the intense ending right there and life turned into an anime for a split second üòÉ )

### Uh, so how about the next hour? We MOOC'n? What's happening?

Yea, let's see ... it's too early to call the guy about the tools or anything else, and I have brain energy, maybe I'll cap myself at twenty minutes of trying to understand that pattern generation package and it's dependencies, then MOOC, and if it's still raining hard at 9:30 maybe I'll ... well, I'll make up my mind at 9:30. Or is that a trap? Will I have less willpower after I've done work, and should just get my priorities for the day out onto a single piece of paper, like I did yesterday to great effect?

### Yes, it's a trap!

Alright, uno momento ...

// Sweet! Did it! I'm going to make another cup of coffee here and get cracking! üî• Ooo and this coffee is fresh and actually blooms! Thanks to my wonderful sister! Mexican Cafeco from Just Coffee Collective! (TODO LINKS TO THINGS!) Lol, also, it shows how far I've come when my answer to the kettle whistling is, "I hear you." ::clicks stove off:: "And I appreciate you." NB, this is before the back pain kicks in, and Dawa is trying to get my attention now, and the second cup ‚òï, and the neighbors, but it's 9am exactly and the next twenty minutes are Python time, period, go. üêç

### Okay, then! What are we learning?

First we've got to find the links, I wanted the docs open for `shapely`, which sounds like a library for playing with Legos, sort of a cute name, it's actually super hard-core math under the hood which is cool, and `numpy` which I definitely pronounced 'numpee' before making the connection 'number' and 'python' and now I correct myself to 'num-PY' every time which honestly, is it worth it? Anyway, it's like arrays, but super-arrays, faster than native lists, and there's a bunch of helper functions, looks great, wonder how it's used, and then there were a few more imports I wanted to check out before diving in, and I've got to find the link to the code again too, because I tried to open it earlier and couldn't find the link from the post ...

Dawa is good btw, he is snoozing.

Oh, ya, okay, maybe it was a weird thing being on mobile. Oop, nope, just kidding, he removed the source code to commercialize it. Do you, boo.

Okay, so `pandas` handles tabular data and plots graphs, that's what that is. I'm not super sure the person was using it, I was just reminded because of the name.

Oh, wow, I just hit a dead-end on the Internet for the first time in a while. I get to loops on company's sites sometimes that don't work, but most of the time I don't see a straight-up "To be completed" on a ... two! I just hit another 404! I was going to write 'large website', talking about the NumPy documentation page, and at the bottom I noticed it said, "Written in Sphinx!" with a link, and I was like 'What in the world is that', and the link blasted an nginx 404. Woof.

IT'S BEEN TWENT ...

Ha, whoops, caps lock, I'll leave that in though, that's funny, just imagine my face being shocked for a second because now the screen is yelling at me.

Anyway, it's been twenty minutes, we must MOOC. The puppy is up, though, I don't know if I'm going to m ... oh no. We're going out. Oh boy.
Still raining. // Oh, jk, we're not, I turned the lights out and suited up to leave but he laid back down and went to sleep. Snuck a little grooming in, but I think it's time to get the laundry going and get some exercise in. To the future!

// Jk we were, and also I did the laundry and got exercise in ... Dawa probably needs another walk after I put myself together here. Go!

// Yeap, he needed another walk, but was acting really weird and either was drinking dew or eating grass, and drinking dew is fine I guess, but eating grass means throwing up, so we came back in and I headed out for groceries. Since it was raining I just walked, it's like 2.5 miles, and I juggled on the way there, for a little extra training. Dawa needed another walk when I got back, of course, and then I cooked like, dinner and a half for him because he'd eaten the pork off the top of last night's dinner that he never ate, but then I had some hamburger meat thawing and put some of that and au jus over the dry food. He was whining at me after I'd shown him the food in his bowl and I have to say I lost it a little and yelled for him to shut up. He appears to have gotten over whatever barrier was preventing him from eating the food, though who knows what long-term effects the yelling will have on our relationship and his behavior. It doesn't excuse the outburst, I show him a lot of love on the regular though, and like, Keith was saying earlier, when he drove us to New Haven that one time and I left for a second to do my errand there, Dawa was so sad that I was gone. It's just a lot, because there are things on my todo list that aren't done, and I'm glad I was able to write a bunch today, training is going well and all that, but holy moley being in such a small space with this dog and we haven't been to either Harkness or the trail behind the Waterford dog park in a while because the roads have been torn up for like a month, so running him ends up being under duress because his little footpads get thin just running around the block on the pavement, and it's hardly an adventure without the bike ride anyway.

Eugh, I haven't even done the MOOC thing yet today, much less hardly anything directly profitable! And Dawa is just looking at me and snorting and licking his arm now, and it's like ... how do I focus on programming when and now he's panting, shut the hell up!

Okay, hold a mirror up in this moment of failure. You didn't actually say that last part to him. Breathe. First, it's going to be okay, even though you're tired, because it's not like someone else is going to let him out without a leash or collar or anything on, or take him out to walk and drop the leash, because it's just us now and I don't like ... _have_ to take him out nomatter what condition I'm in, he can be okay for a bit.

Who just secured **therapy** for themselves though! Holy moley! Hooray! What a different type of call, too, like, with the psychiatrist, they're the kind of doctor, nice enough person mind you, but where I put myself as together as possible for the video call and I do my best to convince them I'm not a totally crazy person and I could have some medicine but _not_ be locked up that would be so great thanks so much, and I made a little joke about I'll be happy to make the next video call as long as society was still functioning then, and like the next few minutes they went off on Trump and the whole situation and it was like ... I'm here for anxiety, in (a major) part, please, dios mio, why am I consoling you ... but that's how it is right now. Everyone's stressed.

Okay, well, just being able to sit for a second here, I think I can keep pushing. I don't know, maybe not, honestly, I think I'll probably crash here and roll everything over to tomorrow. He pooped a small poop earlier around midday, and since he didn't eat his dinner last night, no wonder, and so then that makes ... yea I mean he was able to relieve himself before second-dinner, maybe I'll walk him if I'm awake again late at night, but knock out sooner rather than later.

Push site, hit reset button on self, cya tomorrow morning! Best wishes! ~g
