Goooood morning! Up early today, and we're on the second work sesh already. Also the dishes are done, except for a few I just made, le sigh, I'm put together, the dog is walked, it's raining, let's do this thing!

So I've already streamed working on `master-blaster` for a while, I want to put just a little effort into my website before redoing my application and getting to job stuff today. I'm in standing desk mode and am going to have to keep moving about and stretching, or the back pain is going to take over. Did a lot of sitting yesterday and this morning, and I had a fair bit of breakfast, and really shouldn't be trying to push my legs or any part of me today, so we've got some forest sounds playing on Spotify, all of the lights up, let's groove!

Maybe I should practice what I preach and use a Figma doc? ... Ooor apply the same kind of approach I was taking this morning and refactor it so it's more manageable before making real changes ... yea, let's see, issue-driven development time!
