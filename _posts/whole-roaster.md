Good morning! It's been a day so far, let's see ... up early, no dishes to contend with, just rain! And now snow! Ahh! Dawa still needs more walking at some point, and it's not set to stop any time soon ... so I think I'm going to push to get as much done midday as I can here, walk out to get groceries, and then when I get back I'll take him out, I'll already have been out in it then. The laundry is done, recycling and trash taken out, vacuuming got done, and I got a workout in ... so we're looking pretty good here as far as non-important stuff goes, lol.

What happened to yesterday, anyway? Pretty sure I cooked and cleaned all day. There's soup.

What happened coding-wise this morning though, that's the question!

I got roasted!

Well, actually the person ended up being very nice about it, and I was worried they were going to spend eighteen minutes going line by line and saying how bad of a programmer and person I was, lol. This person was asking if anyone wanted their code reviewed on Reddit, and I responded, and then a few days ago they messaged me that the video was up on YouTube ðŸ‘€ !!

It was great, actually, the main point was that if it was better organized, rather than being a thousand lines of procedural code, it would be comprehensible and testable, and he went through how he'd start to abstract the gist of the program in an object-oriented style. Phew. That was pretty funny stuff though, honestly, when he says, "This can be most easily illustrated by just looking here ..." and zooms in to him mousing over the number of lines of code! ðŸ¤£

Here's my video that I made in response with this great tool called [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) for screen/camera recording:

Ooo, I also got an hour of MOOC in today! It's been productive day so far, so much more to do though!

// VOTED!
