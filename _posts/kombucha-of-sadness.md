Good morning! It's not even four yet, which is the only way I'm going to get away with coding today, once the sun is up I'm going to make a tremendous mess, in the best way possible: virtual garage sale time! Until then, I'm going to try and make my website as fabulous as possible and put off being sad about my only queer friend at the dog park up and leaving last night!! I've got her kombucha making kit, and sent her off with a care package. Eugh, why.

Okay, code. Move the little blocks around with the special words, lol.

Okay actually while I'm complaining, I'm going to go off for a second and go all caps, lo siento DOES THE WHOLE GODDAMN INTERNET NEED TO BE IN LIGHT MODE WHY IS THIS THE STANDARD, PEOPLE, WHY?

Sigh. Breathe. Code. Make your site dark mode if you want, move.

Currently have this song Leaving Earth 2 by Medasin on repeat-1, sooo good.
