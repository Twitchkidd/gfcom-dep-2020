Good morning! I wonder what other people do to get their computers into work mode? I'm probably slacking, it's definitely, like, _part of the routine_ though.

I want to fix two things before anything else today, one being the layout of the cards, because they're a jumbled mess, first the quote of the day though, for a (hopefully) quick win. Two elements vs. five.

Oh, turns out "trepedatious" is a word because people use it and know what it means, not because it's in a dictionary. "Trepidation" is a word in the dictionary, "trepedatious" can be searched for on Twitter and get hundreds of thousands of hits.
