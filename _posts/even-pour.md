Good morning! Yay I fixed the new-post script and made it delightful! Got some Node practice in, too, which I clearly needed, lol. Today's lesson was on using `figlet -l >> fonts.txt` then `const readInterface = readline.createInterface({ input: '/path/to/file', output: process.stdout, console: false });` and `readInterface.on('line', line => { console.log(figlet.textSync('New Blog Post!', { font: line, width: 80}))});` to print out all the figlet fonts saying, "New Blog Post!" and now my `np` command prints it out in one of the seven ones I like best at random!

Thanks to Vasyl Lagutin for writing [this article on best practices for reading files line by line!](https://stackabuse.com/reading-a-file-line-by-line-in-node-js/)

Hmm, just spent a while trying to get syntax highlighting to work. _Not_ my most focused morning here. Time to move on with the day, lol. Surprisingly difficult to get syntax highlighting working, though, I thought that would only take a minute.

/// It's Future-Me! All I can say for yesterday is I'm going to need more training before I can regularly take Dawa to either Harkness or the Waterford park with the push stroller. The fine folk at Wayfarer replaced my cable, so I can pick it up at noon. Back to the future with me, and best wishes dear reader!
