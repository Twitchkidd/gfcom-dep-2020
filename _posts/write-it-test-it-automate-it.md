Good morning! Definitely noticing that the sun isn't up as early these days! Works fine for me, though, the patio isn't a blazing inferno at 7:15, and I'm going to just wire up this virtual garage sale page and get right back to posting things. Go go go!

Alright, sweet, felt good to author that, that's all we need for the moment, then the next task is making it work, I don't really need to be creatively on point for that though. I'm going to get Dawa exercised and then bust the next part out. It's also very quickly turning back into disco inferno on the patio at 7:50.

Oh, aside, have you seen this, because ohh mmm geeee:
