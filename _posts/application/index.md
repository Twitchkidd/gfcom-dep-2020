Gooood ... afternoon? Afternoon. It's been a day, so far, but I need to jump right in, here. I got a Google Maps key to work with, went through the last video in the Geolocation section in the Learn Node series, and I looked at a few examples of how people used CRA and Express together, I think what I'm going to do though, to cement my knowledge, get something functional up, and get used to refactoring, and not have to galaxy-brain today because for whatever reason I'm just not filled with energy and creativity today, is to start up another branch of run-club-web where I basically remake it how Wes has Dang That's Delicious set up at this point in the series, and then refactor it after that. Ready, set, go!

Oh, you know what, I'm just going to rename it dep-run-club-web and make the git repo private, now I know how to use dotenv.

// Oof, hours later! I think I've got everything in _relatively_ minimalistically, just need to put the fonts in and get some icons going. And yes, I read the webpack config! Which I might not otherwise have, lol. Oh boy.

Okay, so _now_ it's a job application party, or as my mother would've said, a partay. :) Made sure I got supplies, got some soup in, walked Dawa, fed Dawa, got some music going, drinks, snacks, aaand apply to jobs time! Aaand my Internet cuts out, nice :) ... It came back :)

// Well, I only tied the number of applications I put out yesterday, but several were from the 'tier 1' list today, and I spent extra time on them! Got back from the after chow-time walk with Dawa and our across-the-way neighbor was in handcuffs! Wonder what we missed.

I have a good point to pick up again tomorrow, going to sign out for now and call it a night, stoked for an early day tomorrow though! Dawa and I had a day off from our runs, which have been getting longer, and I've been going for long enough here I know what a good next route will be!

Best wishes!
