Good morning!

Today is looking like it's going to knock yesterday out of the park. Up early, the dog has been run, I got six miles barefoot in, I'm put together and rockin' and rollin' here by 9, let's do this!

First we MOOC.

Yea! Implemented a class, wrote a program, passed all the tests, one go. Getting this!

// Okay, forty-five minutes of sitting and my back says no more, lol. I think it's probably dishes time, that's got to get done, and I need to make some beans and rice, because I've got an onion and there's not a whole lot of other food right now.

// Wow, so, another walk with Dawa, got some work done out of the house, there was this whole race back from and to and back from New London again involving a real stand up guy named Pat and a light roast Columbian, and then there was first meeting for therapy, which I'm not going to write about here, lol, but then that was the end of getting work done. Groceries got fetched, Dawa got taken to the park for a while, Dawa got fed, and I'm at the desk like I'm going to work more, but it's not happening. Tomorrow a lot of work is going to happen, and I won't have to think about therapy, and I won't have to think about much but the pile of todos in front of me, and I will likely be able to handle Dawa without too much trouble tomorrow. Dear Reader keep your fingers crossed for my back tomorrow, today was okay ... :)

A little light on the content here, but it was a pretty productive day, stoked about tomorrow, good night and best wishes, ~g
