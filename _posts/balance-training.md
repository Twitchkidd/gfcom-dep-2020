Good morning! Whooof, I need to just write it into my brain that I'm never going to be able to get any coding in before I take Dawa out, and not that I should move any _slower,_ but going as fast as possible isn't going to make it happen, and I need to not get mad about it. Dawa sees me put the place together, smells the coffee, and knows it's time for a walk. That's just how it goes, G, doesn't matter if you get up at four in the morning. Actually four might do it, that might be the magic time where if you tread ever so softly, you might be able to use your brain for a bit in this critical morningtime, before the shock of first walkies.

I also need to write into my brain to actually look at what the temperature is outside, and _then_ make clothing and accessory decisions, because it was forty-three this morning and two sweatshirt layers and a hat did okay, but a neck buff and some gloves would have meant that Dawa would have gotten a longer walk, because we went right in after being at the park for a few minutes, I was cold. Poor little guy. It was quarter to six though, we'll get more adventure in later.

For now, I MOOC with a vengeance! (Huh, 'v-e-n-g-e-a-n-c-e'. "Middle English: from Old French, from venger, vengier ‘avenge’, from Latin vindicare ‘vindicate’." ~Oxford Languages)

Yea, part 5! Let's do this!

Song of the day: Get Lucky, the Super Guitar Bros cover!

9:30 - Got some scanning in, Dawa got a significant amount of grooming, I made breakfast rice and bean tacos, doing well here.

I've got to think of what we can do ... might be bike with him to Harkness time, his little peets are worn down, he should run, though. At least the sun's out. Okay, to minimize my risk of injury, since I'm on kinda dead legs right now, 1) Large cup of coffee and putting myself together, inbound. The more alert and ready to go with the flow, the better. 2) Air in the tires and the chain lubed. 3) Different shoes for biking and running. 4) Do your best to be patient at first. Yes, we're there to run, not to look around, but let's work on the start and the end of the run being as good as possible. 5) No going on the sand. I can't really take that right now, doesn't go well unless he's perfectly groomed (Sand. Hair.) and can go free, because he can _really_ move it on sand, in like two paces. Maybe we should try Seaside.

There's a thought! That's something new! Ha**ha**, adventure time!

// Okay, so, multiple adventures later, and I'm pooped, though relatively uninjured ::knocks on wood::. Dawa has been walked and fed and I'll be darned if I'm not going to bundle up right now, it's like cold, and has been a long day. Tomorrow is Monday, looking forward to take it on head-first, I don't have it in me right nowå though, lol.

Best wishes!
