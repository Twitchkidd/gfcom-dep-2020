Good morning! We're in the thick of it! I'm going to build out the Virtual Garage Sale section of the website based on the spreadsheet I made yesterday of all the things on sale (and sold!) and then get to posting more. Oh, was there something first? I was planning my whole day out and I'm sure I put something in between the two ... Mais c'est la vie.

La vie!

// Oh fun! I got the Google Sheets API up and running, so I'm not going to be copying and pasting out of it! Hooray! Okay, let's work out what data we want to use to display items ... so the progress bar, I need the total number of items, and a total number of items that have been sold already, and then let's see ... probably use the saleAttempt title and description, because if people click through, that's what they'll see ...

Ayyy, made another sale! Alright!!

I'm going to have to go back to listing items soon enough, but let's keep going here for another minute ... we'll need a list of categories, so we can do ye ole h1, h2, grid of cards, h2, grid of cards type thing, and I'd love to sort those so that partially sold categories are at the top, and then totally unsold categories, and then any categories where all items have been sold. Then, let's see ... the link, the filenames of the photos ... that will just require splitting along the comma, and I guess ... hmm, carusel time, and I'll have the various flights as a hero carusel ... maybe just use the first image for items? Ooo, or if you could have a non-automatic carusel in the cards for any items with multiple images, and clicking the handles would progress photos, but clicking any photo would open a tab with the item's post? And then price, so don't show one if it's sold, nobody needs to know that, just highlight them, and then so unsold items, show the price, and if there are more than one sale attempts, show like a 'down from \$x!' with the previous price ...

Ooo, and I heard back from a recruiter! He seems nice. Very exciting! Okay, I've got to get moving here. I can't sit any longer, and don't feel like using the standing desk. (Honestly my ankle is killing me, really would rather not be biking to the post office right now, oh well though, haha.) My reward for working hard the rest of the day will be getting the VGS page up! ðŸ˜ƒ
