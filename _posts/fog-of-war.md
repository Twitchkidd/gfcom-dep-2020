Good morning! Okay, so I think I'm somewhat caught up on sleep here; most of my body really wanted to go for a run this morning, just not my Achilles ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Got Dawa out on a short run and biked to the store to get a few things though, so we're good to go for a while here.

Lol, sort of.

Mentally and emotionally I'm not really caught up; with everything going on, I've had three breakdowns already today and it's not even noon ... and they weren't even over coding (eugh, jk.) Almost over coding, though, I've been in Express/Pug land for long enough I've forgotten how to do simple things in JS/React ...

// Uhh, so, got somewhat further with that, listened to some tech podcasts, and due to unforseen circumstances, I'm going to call it an evening and make an effort to establish the early rise that I so prided myself on not so long ago. What a time to be alive.

Best wishes.
