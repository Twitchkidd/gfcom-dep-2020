Good morning! Dawa and I got to Harkness today! Got another half hour of biking, too, because we were a little too early, they open at eight, but now it's go time! I'm currently on the patio hiding from Dawa. He's got food, fresh water, air conditioning, and we stopped at the dog park on the way back and he got to say hello to a few of his friends. I might have to grab a chair, though, I thought I was going to be able to do the standing thing, but I don't think my back can take it.

Next step is to take the todos for the site and bring them into a kanban so I can have this all in front of me. I got some mental clarity overnight on the problem I had at the end of yesterday, so that'll probably be the first issue I tackle, and really it is just making an issue out of it, because it's going to wait, if it was going to be simple that'd be one thing, but it's going to take a little more involvement.

Oh, let me just post yesterday's ... boyo, am I not going to miss the deployment process I've got set up right now. I copy the blog content to the parent directory, switch to the oldSchool branch , rm the blog content there, move the new blog content in, clear the cache, clear public, run the build, drag over the two files and at least two folders into Cyberduck, commit changes, and back to branch next. Bleh.
