Good morning! I've got a system set up and just need to set up the low table and the plants, walk Dawa one more time, because we were out at like 5:15 and it's 8:15 now, time for adventure, and then pick random numbers between 0 and 254, post the hell out of things, populate the spreadsheet, and then when everything is posted I'm going to have a way to display all the items and their statuses on my website and it's going to be faaabulous and also really need to make money right the bleeping now thank you go go go, lol.
