Gooood morning! Still morning! Wow! Lot done so far today, we're rocking and rolling.

Last night I connected with Patrick and we coded for three hours! He's doing so well! Looking forward to the next session, we're at the point where he's got some understanding of source control and how to use GitHub, and we've got a project up and running, but like just the very very base level, we've got an index.html, README.md, and a Figma file.

Let's see, today ... well, I slept in until 6, because I was up late last night and had gotten Dawa out, which honestly I might continue if meetings with Pat are going to be on the later side due to the time difference. Got Dawa out on a run this morning, 2.5 miles, not bad, little guy! Grooming, too, but oh man he needs so much more. He's sleeping peacefuly and I'm not going to wake him. ðŸ˜ƒ

What else, got some work done on the postings, that's rockin' and rollin', got one item of clothing repaired and another is in progress, got some healthy food in, sent Patrick a pull request of something I woke up thinking about, and I want to go through the RedwoodJS tutorial. Hearing Tim Berners Lee talk about it on ... the Smashing Podcast? Yea ... anyway, hype! I need to do other things for a bit though, and the postings definitely take precedence. Please, please, self, please bust that out today. Really we're not even halfway through with it, but this chunk would be _really nice_ to get online and hopefully gone.

Just finished a coffee, and my back say no more sitting for a while. To the future!

// Good LORD. I ... stuff got done, not an unproductive day, but I spent like four hours outside today! I don't want to go anywhere to get away from my doh, and he's still just sitting next to me and staring at me, like, he ate a generous portion of a chicken that I cooked just for him, he's had ... is it that we only did a little bit of training today? I feel like my life is totally off the rails. I have no idea how anyone with actual children are handling the pandemic.

At least I could listen to tech podcasts for some of that time. At least Richard got back to me and didn't die like I'd feared, and the whole tools thing could go down tomorrow. At least I got **some** work done on the important stuff. Just need to narrow the unnamed stuff down to the crystal, then put the crystal stuff into sets, compare the sets to the remaining names for crystal things, write the rest of the descriptions, price them, post them. I just can't get a break from my dog needing, apparently, to meander at length, which I really do not have the patience for. I have no idea what to do except to put myself down for the night and just try not to think about it, and set the alarm for early tomorrow. I'd set the day light to go off later, 5:45, because if we go out at 6:15 these days, there's a little bit of light, but fuck that. Little bastard is going to get a walk at 4:30, and he's going to like it, and I'm going to work from 5:15 to as long as I can stretch it, SO DONE!!!

Well, sorry if anyone actually reads this.

I guess to finish on a bright note, heard from Lynn today and everyone is holding up, apparently. Blessings and a knock on wood for y'all.

Best wishes, ~g
