Good morning! And what a morning so far! I guess nothing too crazy, Dawa got me out before I got my routine going (and goodness, no wonder,) and I've only just now has coffee touched these lips, feels like ... well it feels like those other times of the day when I'm not caffeinated. Bleh. ðŸ¤£

Alright, what's on the docket? Got some scanning going on on the side here, and I didn't hardly make any progress with ... lord, did I get _anything_ done yesterday? Surely, right? Seemed like it. Le sigh. Damn, yea, look, there's the todo list, anything checked off? No. Disgraceful.

Okay, little distraction, Dawa needed some grooming. Whoop, needed more. Little trim of the hair around the paws, got as much of trimming his claws as he'd permit, and he was trying to scratch his back, so as much brushing as he'd permit. It might be close to time when I need to give him another chill pill and have a day where I get all that done. Before Halloween, I guess, as that's when the big (and hopefully socially distanced?!?) party for all the dogs is. My plan for that is to get Dawa's picture with the other dogs in costume, drink heavily with Ryan for a short time, and get the hell out of there. It's been nice being generally around people at the dog park, holy moley though.

AND DAWA IS ASKING FOR MORE ATTENTION! When am I supposed to live my life? It's tempting to drag him around the block to try to tire him out, but I think his little paws are a little worn down from that already but the roads are even crappier now, wtf do I DO?!?!!

Okay, keep going. I didn't yell, or react at all, the ship isn't sunk yet. For the moment, just keep scanning, no agency required, just keep moving.

See, look, that's another album scanned. Dawa needs more attention. Attention given. Get more pictures.

Okay, I'm back, I feel more myself, I went down a manual pages dive on the 'tk' program, which is a cross-platform GUI framework basically (?) and was written back in '91 (!). A truck just went by and roared and hissed and squealed into my ears, so hello once again rage monster, lol.

Inhale. Exhale. Skip forward to 'Inside the Hyperbolic Time Chamber' by baaasKat. Volume slightly down, single repeat.

Cars blaring music going by is fine, that's cultural. Keep moving. Load the MOOC. Scan more.

Ooo, we're up to the last exercise in this section! It's got six parts! Cray! And I snuck in a little adulting task. Momentum! Dawa slumbers.

Yay, bing bang boom. Up to 'objects in a list'!

Ahh, string comparison gotcha in Java, it's `if (name.isEmpty()) {` not `if (name == "") {`. Eugh, and I wasted like five minutes there because the output needed a new line to pass the tests. We'll get there.

// Aaand another walk! We've had seven poops today! Then he whined at me while I was eating, it was like, really dude, way too much right now, but I've got some pork on the stove ... and we're up. Also, I hadn't had coffee since like seven and it's 11:30. Not today, this ball isn't rolling without coffee. ... aaand coffee. Gooood morning! Ooo it actually is, 11:37, nice.

// Back at it after a little break, and back's the word, I had to lie down, my back was killing me. It's starting to hurt again, too. ... if it could not? Stuff to do today? It's hard to read or type while writing in pain. Okay, one more good crack ... maybe I can sit like _this_ for a while? It's like click, click, type, type, arrgghh, arrgghh, flail, flail, crack, sigh, click, click, type, type, arrgghh ... Ooo, I just stuck my knuckles _deep_ in there. I can't even ... ohh ... nope ... I've gotta look funny. That last one, maybe I can hold this for a bit. // Lasted like a minute thirty. Okay there ... eugh, another fifteen minutes rolling on the ground. I have to get out of here.

// Dear Reader, it's evening and the back pain hasn't let up. The dog has been taken care of. The last thing I'm going to do while sitting here, in the breaks between having to rearrange my spine to avoid the shooting pains, is take a Google Street View tour of Colchester, because there's this whole thing with running, but more on that later because I can barely get _this_ scraped out ðŸ¤£

Best wishes, ~g
