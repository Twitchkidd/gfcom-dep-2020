Good morning! Got some things done today already! I've had two cups of coffee though and my back hurts and I'm having trouble breathing! Yaaay! Figuring out python packaging is next, but I'm losing my mind at the moment, so I'm going to take a break! Got some standing desk time in though, that seemed to help with things. Eugh. To the future.

/// Oop, nope, day was awful. Happens. Did my best to stay sane. Doing my best to stay sane. The place is clean at least, and I'm going to hold on to that. Hoping waking up early tomorrow will solve all my problems, lol.

Best wishes.
