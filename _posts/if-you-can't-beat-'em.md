In which we take a MOOC! The University of Helsinki's CS1 Introduction to Programming and Advanced Programming is in Java and it's a Massively Open Online Course! (MOOC!) I was looking for resources, and this was pinned to the top of r/learnjava, so excited! I should like, plan this though, and not just spend the next four hours learning Java and burn out.

Whoop, nope, actually after taking the dog out, my body demanded I run, so I got four-something in in the _wildest_ weather I've been out in in a hot minute. I realize I just used 'in in' twice, and should edit later.

----------------------------------------EEEEEDDDIIIITTTT MEEEEE------------------------------------ -------------------------------------------

Then the dog wanted another walk, which was totally fair, because he hadn't pooped yet, but he took me for the full mile around the block after going to the park and sniffing up the hill a bit, which I thought was a bit cheeky of him, but here we are.

Oh, yea, the _wind_ though, oh my gosh must've been like forty mile an hour gusts, whitecaps all up the river, boats tossing, wires whipping, signs flexing in the wind, and at first I was just thinking I was headed around the block, but I felt great at the top of the hill and just kept going, and I had to pack the electronics away pretty quickly, but there wasn't anyone out, so I just turned my phone all the way up, and kept a pretty good pace up for a while, all things considered ... oh, yea, actually the gps is saying 8:52 average miles, with drops to 13+, but a non-zero amount of time spent sub six. This was one of the runs where "Naruto running" was employed as a tactic, since getting low reduced the drag by enough to continue forward at a running pace, but you still have to be counter-acting the rotation that the hips are generating, hence the both hands way back, lats engaged, and it really is not enough to duck your head and whip back your hands and picture yourself in an anime, you have to be leaning so far forward at the hips that you're almost falling over, it's really not like ... well I mean if you can maintain that for more than like two minutes you've got me beat, but in _certain situations_ it's better than running upright. One is if you're actually almost falling over and suddenly find yourself either running or face-planting, that's when you'll often see people do the Naruto run accidentally for a moment, and then there's going under something, or if you are going just really blazingly fast and you're in tune with your stride right down to the toes, you can hit really crazy cadence for a little bit.

... but I digress, lol.

Before I left, I left myself some

todos that I had to get to before I got to anything even remotely looking like fun, so thaaat'll be next. I put my phone over the todo notes, I think that contributed to going on about running for a while instead of working, because I moved my phone back over, and that unchecked box with a simple description is just _looking_ at me, you know? Something nice about physical pieces of paper for things.

- Update resume with Next.js.

Update Google Doc in cloud. Save as PDF, send to Drive, send to phone, open in TurboScan, export page one to photos, upload photo to drive, download to computer, _then_ that's done. The template for my resume is great, but it mysteriously spans two pages, and I have no idea why, I can't get it to stay on one page, it's impossible ... **so** ...

Ok, phew, one resume, with way better verbiage in a few places, mucho bueno, got the jpg, got the pdf, I need to upload it to LinkedIn, get a bitly link to it, and put that on my homepage, go. JK, you do not upload resumes to LinkedIn ... shows what I know about it, lol. Wow, nice, I got [bit.ly/garethfieldresume](https://bit.ly/garethfieldresume) for the Google Drive link, pretty happy about that, lol.

Oof, decided to get up and do something not sitting for a second, and I need to print something out for voting, and the printer told me Cyan was out, and now it's Magenta and Yellow now that I got the Cyan. Staples does free next-day delivery, which is nice. Printers. ðŸ˜ 

// Wow, back pain took me _out_ at 1pm! I was floored, like had to lie down and writhe on the floor for like half an hour. Other stuff happened the rest of the day but I need to wrap up this post now! Ouch, lol. Best wishes, ~g
