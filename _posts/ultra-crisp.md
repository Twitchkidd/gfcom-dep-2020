GOOD MORNING! If you couldn't tell by the description, I'm losing it a little today, but the spinach really was some of the best spinach I've had lately. They didn't have any of the small containers so I risked getting a big one, it didn't turn out soggy or rubbery at all though. Even just touching it aroused some serious anticipation, and the crunch **delivered.** Dopeness.

Anyway, it's raining a little, so Dawa took me for a mercifully short walk and did his business right in the dog park, rather than up the hill. So here I stand wasting these precious moments writing about it. ðŸ¤£ J/k though, computer is fired up, I've got a list, let's do this thing. Also, I feel fantastic right now and don't want to forget it, this is _nice._ I took Dawa to Oswegatchie yesterday, so we're both physically all set, got a coffee in, and the place is a mess, but it's my mess, I know where things are, and I don't have my next steps planned exactly, it feels like the type of thing that whirlwind mode is going to handle though. I love whirlwind mode.
