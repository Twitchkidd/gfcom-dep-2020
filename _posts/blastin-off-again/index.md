Good morning!

Okay, so I think I've got the flow of `master-blaster` back, I'm going to just rely on devs being able to generate a token and bring it back to the terminal ... hopefully they can do it, hopefully this is still faster than going through 60 repos one by one, hopefully this lowers the barrier to changing branches from master to main or whatever, let's go! Then when I run out of energy later I've got some hardware stuff to do! Yay!

New machine is great, btw, though I'm having a hard time using the right-click function on the trackpad, and it's running a little hot. No WONDER, though, how did they get a whole computer in here?! It's TINY!

Ok go go go!

Ahhhh, I'm not used to python environment stuff yet! I ran pipenv install -e . and pipenv shell, and _then_ I was able to run master-blaster ... eep though.

Hey, this is going pretty smoothly now! Yay for libraries! Yay for [questionary!](https://github.com/tmbo/questionary)
