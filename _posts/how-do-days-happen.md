Good afternoon! Dawa has been ran today, and got a bike ride, and now chow time, and Dad was here, and I have ten more boxes in my apartment and one more piece of furniture. And a spaghetti squash, at about six pounds. Oh and Charlie has been in touch, hi Charlie. The Moodbit folk haven't been back in touch, and honestly I'm so thankful, like, dealt with Dad today, I've extremely conveniently got an appointment with my shrink tomorrow, lol, and we can go from there.

I'm so far into this MOOC, I'd love to bust out another segment here, I'm not sure Dawa will let me though. We'll see. Section 3, exercise 15 out of the seven sections of Java I, and then another seven for Java II.

If you pass a reference-type variable, most variables in Java, to a method, any adds or removes change the value(s) of the original variable. That's fucking insanity, what? Is it for memory purposes? But there's a build process!! I can't change it, so, moving forwards. Seciont 3, exercise 18.
