Good morning! Long time, no post! What a week!

So I ended up having to move to another apartment, and my other machine isn't working, so I've _just_ got myself back into a working flow here. Got my dot files squared away, not going to have to do _that_ again for a bit, got some artwork commissioned for a game I'm working on for my niece, got someone I'm going to be teaching to code ... yea! Hoping the second part of 2020 is less traumatic than the first half. Who knows though, it still really sucks out there in the world. Gotta do this thing though, so let's go!

/// Yea, okay! Coded! Code happened! Also a lot of back pain happened! Finally got a doctor's appointment for in a month though! First time in more than a decade! We'll pick this up tomorrow, I'm going to do some meal prep and re-pot my orchids! Woo!

Best wishes,
~g
