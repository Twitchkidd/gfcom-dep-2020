Ohhkay, good morning!

First, I'm so happy I got recommended Nectar by Joji, I woke up and put on track 1, and track 1 started playing again when Dawa and I got back from first walkies ... because he took **forever** today. Happy to be with him, I love fresh air, too, but there's no fighting the coffee, I'm going to get stuff _done_ today. Happy birthday, me, let's rock and roll.

Not sure whether it was Cyberduck or Bluehost's deal, but I can fix my website now, yaaay. I'm sure there's just like one file off or something, but it doesn't ever set state properly in index, probably because it's waiting for a bundle to load that's not there, but I don't have tooling set up to diff my build folder and what's on the server, just the build folder and the previous build folder, so incremental updates are fast(er), but the easiest way to update if I mess things up is delete everything and upload everything back, so let me run build, the delete is done ...

Oof, 234mb. Eugh, and I still haven't fixed my git repo, either, it's still got all the images. 1.27gb. Yowza.

We've just got to move on, though. Ooo, first by taking a step back to yesterday though! This guy in LA who I'd helped with some React/JS for an interview hit me up again what's now two nights ago, and I did my best to help him, but honestly I'd had a few cheeky bevs, and the solution I came up with was ... suboptimal, lol.

Fortunately the company he was interviewing with gave him the next day to do the coding challenge, and so we had a two hour video call/screen share/live coding sesh where we went line by line through a much more sane solution that I woke up to just knowing and coded up right away. Love when that happens, thanks brain. It was a good sesh though, took a bit to get the collaboration tech going, it was great after though. Patrick is very smart, and catches on really quickly, there's just a lot _to_ programming. It's like writing, a lot. Obviously I'm not producing a lot of super-polished writing here, lol, but there's the difference between sentences technically working and well-crafted sentences, and you've got to craft a lot of bad sentences and work on it to get there. Anyway, hope he gets it, hope I helped him level up as a dev, and I got paid for it! Not like a lot, lol, but I didn't even ask, so thank you very much Patrick! Feels good to be valued.

Let's try pushing this update, test that that whole thing works, and I just used Docker for the first time ... going through the TerminusDB tutorials ... okgo ...

Haha, yea, that was it, uploading one wrong chunk file brought down my site for a week. Nice.
