Ohhkay, good morning!

First, I'm so happy I got recommended Nectar by Joji, I woke up and put on track 1, and track 1 started playing again when Dawa and I got back from first walkies ... because he took **forever** today. Happy to be with him, I love fresh air, too, but there's no fighting the coffee, I'm going to get stuff _done_ today. Happy birthday, me, let's rock and roll.

Not sure whether it was Cyberduck or Bluehost's deal, but I can fix my website now, yaaay. I'm sure there's just like one file off or something, but it doesn't ever set state properly in index, probably because it's waiting for a bundle to load that's not there, but I don't have tooling set up to diff my build folder and what's on the server, just the build folder and the previous build folder, so incremental updates are fast(er), but the easiest way to update if I mess things up is delete everything and upload everything back, so let me run build, the delete is done ...
