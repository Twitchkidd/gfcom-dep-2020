Okay, so I maaay have spent the better part of this morning struggling with making mock user and run data for the app that will get handled by the templating language correctly, and it's been an adventure, lol. Made myself a little Node tool, that was fun, totally forgot how to start a small Node project for a split second there, and playing with the JavaScript Date object is always a joy. Oof, stuck for the moment, the schema is looking for another document for author, and I'm not sure how I do that with dummy data. It's a beyond the first ten hits on Google problem, so I'm just going to skip it for now.

Cool, the project is at the point where I can start to go through as a user and the dead ends will actually represent what's needed next, I took the fluff out for the most part. Yay! And I made a fun set of users based on the Alice, Bob, and Chuck cast of cryptography characters! Dog walking time! üê∂
