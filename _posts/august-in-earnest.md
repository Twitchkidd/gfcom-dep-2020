Gooood morning! One of the tires for Dawa's trailer got a puncture and I don't know what I might have done with a patch kit, but since it's like 6:30, looks like no bike ride till later, buddy, lo siento! I don't have it in me to just run him right now, either, I'm pretty beat, still recovering from the half marathon a couple days ago.

It's nice and cool out at the moment, Dawa looks like he doesn't mind that I'm not schlepping him across town for a run, and I'm enjoying the patio before the sun blasts me too much here, lol!

Okay, tech-wise, yea, so, current project is this website's layout and just everything, because oof, and then job-wise, still need to polish the resume, write a CV, and then I have to see what I did last time that worked to get me to pump out applications. Also on the tech-todo, try and find someone from the Python community who might help out with at least the packaging problem with `master-blaster` ... not problem, really, I mean, the program works, it packages up just fine, just you need to install the dependencies yourself, and it's not bad, there's only two and they're pretty common, still though, there's got to ... oh, `requests` is a _lot_ of code, oh interesting reading ... time to go in though, the sun is roasting me and my back is hurting from looking down at the screen, as I'm not sure where an extension cord with three prongs might be, otherwise I'd have the second screen and the stand out here, todo though.

// Yea, my body said I was not going to be sitting/standing still looking at a screen for a while, lol. I had to lie on my back for a while and do stretches and then Dawa decided we needed another walk, so I put myself together and we got around the block. Got through that, got some soup and tea in, Dawa's brushed, next step ... next step is to finish this paperwork job I'd started. Very close to being organized, official papers-wise.

Oh what have I been doing for a few days though? Got to the doctor, that was awesome, oh, right, and I worked on the design for the website and wrote out a lot of markup, that was a thread to pick up on. Papers first, though. My floor was like totally covered in mail and the like early yesterday, can't wait to see the place tidy again. Really, really missing caf√©s, too. I hardly ever get as much done as when I'm there and would just feel really guilty doing anything but working intensely, lol.

// Yaaas, I now have a spreadsheet with the subject and location of all of my official papers. I don't have a concrete plan on tackling it, thinking something like decide everything is going to be handled by a certain time, divide by that many days, and make a little randomizer script on what to deal with that day. Feels good to have a spreadsheet though, and I was able to throw some stuff out. Emotionally draining ... :\ ... keep going, though! We've just gotten started and it's going to be so good! :)

Alright, finished the second half of writing the markup for the new site design, exciting, next up is styling.
