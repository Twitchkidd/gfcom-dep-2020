Good morning! Oh shit!

Went on an adventure on already dead legs yesterday, yolo threw my site over to Next.js, and passed out from exhaustion. Pfft, what the heck.

// Todo, insert the screenshots

Eugh, whyyy.

Okay, _go_ though ...

SocialsModal is not defined. Can do, boss. Slapping a library on it, easy solutions for the win right now. Fifty seven hundred stars on GitHub, surely we're good. \_\_next is the root element? Kay, oop, gotta switch computers, the one was on fire. The one thing about an East-facing patio, I've got this tiny nook of shade with my back to the storage where there's shade, but for the computer, nothing until later.

Okay, that was only like a dozen components I just hadn't made yet, thanks Past-Me, but that's handled, and now we have a new and interesting error based on how I slapped the tabs library on there. Worked well enough when everything was split into files. index.js is now 739 lines.
