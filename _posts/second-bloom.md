Good morning! Walked Dawa, got a letter off to my neice, let's get to it!

What are we doing ... we got registration down, just need to go over login/logout middleware, reset password flow, and then today we learn about sending email from Node! (The _most_ exciting stuff, I know ... I think I've spent a good quarter of my time coding on user authentication and that type of thing at this point, oh well, is what it is :) Oh, protected routes, too, and virtual fields, right.

Alright, busted that out, put myself together, walked Dawa again and went through some job listings, onto the next lesson in the course!

Dope, so still in dev-mode, but at least it's sending out fake emails, figured relational data out, time to reapply to the other project ... //

Coded for a while, and when I come back, I must solve the mystery of photo uploads, test the tags page, and test the password reset flow! I can't sit anymore for the moment though.

Boyoo, there are a lot of companies that start with 'Bio' ... so I went through a bunch more potential job listings, and I worked on getting my backup machine up to snuff, I'm really tired though and don't feel like pushing more caffeine into my system, so I'm going to give myself a break for the rest of the evening. I'm going to spatchcock a chicken. Tomorrow I'm going to get a workout in, and Tuesday I'm going to get in a run to destress before the interview, is the plan. Leh'go!

Best wishes,
