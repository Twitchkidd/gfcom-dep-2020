Good morning! About six before I could get myself settled in and sat down here ... there's no plan, either, but the weight of this git repository is an elephant, so good morning mr elephant, let's go on a diet.

Whoa, okay so I had no idea about the wide array of apps that have a 'works with Google Drive' stamp, there's like a whole app store there. G Suite Marketplace. Yikes. G Suite. Unless the stylized 'G' should be read as "Google" ... that makes more sense, I'm calling it Google Suite and Google Suite Marketplace.

I ... I mean, I can't look at the source code for the Apple App Store apps _either,_ but ... like, so I just installed this app (extension? What is this?) Collaboratory and it says you can share Python with it, which sounds cool, but how good did I feel about giving permissions? Not great, except that it was literally recommended by Google in their settings menu and it looks like a Google product, but still there were like no pictures, just a few positive reviews that looked real, one French person saying they couldn't get it to install, someone else trying to use it as bash? Did it install yet?

OH MY GOD THIS IS SO COOL! V. sad that I can't deep dive into this right now, ohhhh maaaan though!!! Phew! Gotta put that on the back burner and fix my site ... eugh, wrestled with sftp for a while, locked myself out, moving on!

I wish the spinach of fortitude fixed my back pain, lol, not the case. I've maybe been sitting too long? Or just with bad posture. Let's try sitting up, activating ye ole silly legs, type through the pain, lol. Oh my god, shoot me, I really cannot ... WWWOOOF, yea, mandatory stretch sesh, it took me like five minutes before I could crack my back the right way. I'm physically a bit of a mess, as the week starts, here.

Okay, bit of stretching, bit of grooming, bit of bread, back to the clickety-clack.

(In a Brooklyn mechanic's accent:) Now, see, here's your problem right here, you've got forty folders and a hundred and forty files at the base level on your Google Drive, some of those files going back to mid-October, _2016_.

Aw, the back pain is back. :(

Whoa, found the spreadsheet of all my running data leading up to my first ultra. Crazy. That was a lot of running and walking, lol. Once I fix the main layout on mobile and the VGS page, charting running data has got to happen!

I put everything into/archive-2020-09-28 🤣 // Dog time go 🐶

/// From the future! Forgot to document the later part of the day, nothing Earth-shattering though. Best wishes! ~g
