Good morning! Up early, and boyoo has 'early' changed! I dig it! Beanies ftw.

I've got to get focused here, and so each item in the spreadsheet needs to be either listed, relisted, updated, and then the images on my website ... I just got 3.9mb down to 194kb, and for whatever reason ... oh, hey, so 3.9mb files weren't being _served_ at least, the optimizer was working, but it was trying to optimize a 3.9mb file, sooo ... and yea, so over a fifty second load time on wifi ... whoops!
