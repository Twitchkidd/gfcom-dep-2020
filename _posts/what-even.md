Good morning! I got myself up and started my day at 2:30 rather than trying to go back to sleep, lol, and I feel like I could totally have a ... how do we say? Mental breakdown-style episode where I rethink my life? Everything's a little crazy right now. I'm going to MOOC for a little, instead, and we'll take it from there.

Ooo, yay, working with Node and Python _is_ helping learn Java! I would have been stuck on that last one a while, but reading files in Java works like reading files in Node and Python, where when you read the next line, that moves the cursor along, so when I did two comparisons between the value of the next line in a conditional, I was moving the cursor twice because I didn't assign that value to a variable and then use _that_ in the conditional. Nice. Oh, I can't sit any more. Bleh. Still, advanced by three exercises! Only three more in this part and then ... two more parts on objects, and then three larger exercises, and that's Java 1!

Yo ... Java 2 ends in building Asteroids! Go go go! ü§£

// Oof. I ended up knocking back out and getting up at 7:45. Just trying to keep moving. I can do this.

// I did stuff! Banking on tomorrow being primed to be super. ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Best wishes, ~g
