Good morning! I'm working out on the patio at the moment, only briefly as it's started to rain, I'm really missing being able to bike in to Starbucks in like ten minutes and see a friendly face and be able to work someplace where my dog isn't. I love him dearly, but I'm feeling totally overwhelmed. I did end up getting more sleep last night than I've been getting, still very tired though. Arrg.

Okay, good news time! Finished all the episodes of The CSS Podcast! Feeling ready to take the UI on! Next up is still posts logic, though, I didn't end up finishing that last night, so let's get that going.

The example blog starter from Next has parts in ... lib/api, lib/markdownToHtml, public/assets/blog, \_posts/, components/\*, pages/posts/[slug], pages/index ... and that seems to sum it up.
