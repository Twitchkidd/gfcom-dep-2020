Good evening! Morning was a long bike ride and medium length trail run, and getting Dawa totally taken care of, groomed, played with, trained, fed, walked, belly rubs, check, check, check. I feel like streaming fixing `master-blaster` on Twitch, which I'd love if my past self heard that's what I was doing, without any context, and I could see their reaction. Mais c'est la vie.

I think I'll put up a message in text saying if anyone actually joins to watch, let me know so I can increase the font size and get the airpods in. Or maybe I should just do it. ... yea, nvm, just =as if= or you're going to lose literally anyone in under two seconds.

These pumpkin seeds are really good, though, mabye just a message about that.
