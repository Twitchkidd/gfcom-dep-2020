Good morning! I guess that would be just blue, 'blueberry-colored'. Alright, anyway, it's nice and early, the dog is handled for the moment, coffee's in, surroundings are acceptably clean and tidy, let's do this!

A few quick fixes before switching to posting mode that I thought of walking Dawa, should take fifteen minutes: fix the card layouts, add numbers to the progress bar, percents to each category, visually differentiated the Craigslist and eBay cards, and the sold items should not link and show text saying "Found a home." I forgot about those last ones, let's call this half an hour.

I wonder if everyone knows what Siri is at this point, for the most part. Like, we don't talk about cars like, "and then they got in their automobile, a gasoline-powered, self-propelled carraige," and it's not like the big tech companies are going to let any other robot voices in ... like Alexa is waiting down an alley with a baseball bat for Epstein the Epson voice assistant ... okay, coding time, what prompted that was I asked Siri to set the timer for half an hour, and now it's several minutes later. ðŸ¤£

Uncaught TypeError: [...][(attemptnumber - 1)] is undefined

Nice. What did I do, I broke it.

virtual-garage-sale.js:209:29

```javascript
image: [row[8], row[15], row[21]][attemptNumber - 1].includes(',')
					? [row[8], row[15], row[21]][attemptNumber - 1].split(',')[0].trim()
          : [row[8], row[15], row[21]][attemptNumber - 1],
```

Boo. Is it an image thing? Oop, I messed up my database. "Database" being a Google Sheet, kinda cool using the API for this though, not gonna lie. I was halfway through adding a post and had included it in setting the number of items to look for, and so cell I29 was empty, crashing the build.

Next, why are the cards that size? I'm not even sure who's what here, we've got three containers, it's all a link, oh let me fix that part first though, this is going to be way easier, they shouldn't all be links, sold items shouldn't link anywhere, lol.

// OOO THIS STORY GOT REAL GOOD REAL QUICK, SEE YOU IN THE NEXT POST FOR THE WHOLE STORY! BEST WISHES! ~G
