Good morning! Dawa and I went to Harkness today, and I'm glad we got out relatively early, it's supposed to be a pretty warm afternoon here.

Whoops, just realized I broke cover images, lol. Uno momento!

// Oh, that's a pain in the butt, I need to make a script for updating my site. It's down from 45 minutes with the 'blow-everything-away-and-reupload' method to 'file-by-file-with-a-list' in 15 minutes, bleh though.
