Good morning! Okay, so there are still some issues with the virtual garage sale site, but we've got images now! I left out a cell in the spreadsheet and the compile was failing for a while. Now I know that if Next.js throws "JavaScript heap out of memory" it's probably looking for a file that's not there and causing a memory leak. I think I'll make sure the most recent posts have images and just push what I've got up, it's been a minute since I synced.

... and it's going to take a minute ... I've got to do something about these images, it's too much. That's why my machine is going whirrrrr btw, it's trying to optimize like ... way too many images at a way too high base resolution. Big todo.

Lol, oh good, ran into "JavaScript heap out of memory" on the main page ... what did I do ...
