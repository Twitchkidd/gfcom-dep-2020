Good morning! Okay, so there are still some issues with the virtual garage sale site, but we've got images now! I left out a cell in the spreadsheet and the compile was failing for a while. Now I know that if Next.js throws "JavaScript heap out of memory" it's probably looking for a file that's not there and causing a memory leak. I think I'll make sure the most recent posts have images and just push what I've got up, it's been a minute since I synced.

... and it's going to take a minute ... I've got to do something about these images, it's too much. That's why my machine is going whirrrrr btw, it's trying to optimize like ... way too many images at a way too high base resolution. Big todo.

Lol, oh good, ran into "JavaScript heap out of memory" on the main page ... what did I do ...

// OKAY! So! Images are working, website is uploading, I'm going to end up deleting a bunch because I moved a bunch of files I wasn't using out of the project folder, I've had way too much caffeine, but I think I have a few minutes here!

Oooh, and I'm so proud that the site is showing the data at all, this is awwweeesommmeee! I need to savor that, but also go through and get the list of stuff that's obviously broken and needs fixing before I'd really share it, and then I need to square up the spreadsheet with current events, get the system down for adding/updating content, and get this thing rolling and be able to not spend that much time on it in a day so I can work on writing a CV, updating my resume, applying place, networking, all that jazz.
