Good morning! Woof, what a day so far ... we're going to pretend that it starts now though, 9:30am is a perfect time to forget everything that happened between 6:30 and 9, lol. Good things, good things ... someone else messaged me about the mirror, that's exciting, waiting to hear from the job folk, oh boy, and I just had the thought that maybe I could make my own app for the scanner since the default ... is fine, but I might be doing a LOT of scanning, it'd be cool to have my own thing, where it'd scan the document, prompt for info, and then save it to the right place based on that and upload it to Google Drive. There's a ... oh, commercial license?

Interesting. Okay, so TWAIN is the API for working with images in applications, and the TWAIN working group provides a free developer toolkit, and then there's a company Dynamsoft with SDKs that are feature-rich and costly for the commercial license, though developer time is costly too. I think I should probably walk Dawa again, he hasn't pooped. üê∂ $2,200 per year for the core SDK on one server to catch all the supported browsers, or $44,000 for that on one domain! Huh, seven grand for a lifetime license though ... 30 day free trial ... Okay, tabling this. Finish one project before starting another please, lol.

Well, maybe I'll read another 40 pages, and look into twain.js ... oh, you can format disks with this ... I need to not be using this on my main machine until I know what the heck I'm doing, lol.
Git push!

// Wow, goodness, hello from the 24th. Good things have happened since! To the future!
Best wishes,
