GOOD MORNING! (And that was how long before my back started hurting today, oh no, lol. I was going to MOOC ... let's try standing, lol.)

Okay, take two, good morning! Maybe if I bounce like this. Movement helps. MOOC.

Java arrays and ArrayLists are still a little confusing to me. In my mind right now, ArrayLists are like for collections and push-pop logic, and arrays are like mathy arrays, where you wouldn't say it was an array of integers to define it, though that's what it might be, instead with native Java arrays you'd ask more like, "An array of what?" and define it by the conditions of it's creation, since they're fixed length. I wonder if ArrayLists just create new arrays immutably under the hood, or I maybe don't know enough about how data types are constructed to ask the right question there.

Anyway, "Records From A File," let's do this! Oh and standing is much better btw! Yay for my standing desk arrangement. The laptop is on a bin with folders and binders, and the monitor is on the stand and the bin with all of my important papers in it, lol. Aie. But dust in the wind, are we not? Oh, Dawa need attention. Brushing? Oh, and it's running time. Brb.

// And then it was playground time! Yay, said hi to the fam :)

Okay, I thought I was going to have to take Dawa out right away after some training time, but he's eating his dinner, maybe I can sneak some coding in.

Yes, got that one done and Dawa is ready.

/// Lol, Future Me here, no more coding got done this day. Cooking, though, hoo-ee, finally got around to making the soup and rice and beans. It's just a lot that goes into the soup, and coming out the other side of a big cooking night with the dishes done, and whatever the heckin' else I did yesterday ... oh, yea, there was some adulting to do. Bleh. The beans got a two heart-eyes emoji response from Lina, and I gave **three** people soup yesterday, so let's call it a successful day. ðŸ˜ƒ

To the future! And best wishes,
