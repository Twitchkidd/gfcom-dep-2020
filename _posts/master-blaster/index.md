Good ... afternoon, at this point! Today I'm writing a script to rename all the primary branches of your code repositories, as 'master' as in 'master/slave' (no, (really)[https://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2019-May/msg00066.html]) is obviously problematic. I'm calling it master-blaster, and I'm going to give it a shot in Python, and might try Node afterwards if a) I can't get it to work or b) I want to make multiple versions of it!

And I picked the GNU license, which disallows creating closed versions of the program. Not that it would stop racists, they don't have any damn decency to begin with, but it's something.

Next up is testing the testpypi distribution, making a build alias, making it _do_ something, lol, then to pypi! Let's lock that name in!

Ummm and long_description, all that jazz :) (Oh, that's ... that's the whole readme ... got it ... moving these comments over here, lol ...)

And gitignore dist!

/// Ohoookay then! Got a lot done, I'm going to quote SRockwell's law, and I'm going to quote it accurately ... tomorrow morning! What an evening!

Best wishes!
~g!
