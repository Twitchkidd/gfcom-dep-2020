Good morning!

My bad on not posting for a few weeks here! I've been super-stressed trying to get myself together here, and things are going ... well they could be going much worse, let's start there, be real, ground ourselves, all that jazz.

I'm up early today, for the first time since sometime last week, and it's Saturday, I was able to just pop out of bed when the light I use as a sort of first alarm turned on. I ended up not sleeping at all Monday night, and just got myself out of bed at 3 and made coffee, so the week has been about putting my routine together and applications.

Oh, my God, I applied to Smashing Mag, and they said to email them at recruiting@smashingmag.com or whatever the email was, and I wrote the email that Tuesday morning at 6am after another cup of coffee, and they're at least going to have a laugh, I hope. It wasn't like, _that_ bad (and I _would_ be perfect for that job), but at the same time, like, oof. If I can embarass myself that much, though, and dare to even chance to waste _Vitaly Friedman's_ time (oh yay, I got the spelling right, I checked ðŸ˜ƒ), then I can apply for any job.

I was going to say no embarassment could top what I felt on Tuesday after the adrenaline wore off, I should knock on wood on that one though, and accept that surely I will do something so stupid, or _have done_ something so stupid as to deserve far worse embarassment in the future, may I handle it gracefully.

My dog is looking at me. We just got back in from a walk like twenty minutes ago ... okay, good, he got up and laid down on his bed on the sofa. Good boy.

Oh, btw, **little booties!**

Right, I meant to stream some coding, figured I should write some words and get the ole language centers working, catch up with my fan base (lol hi) and all that jazz

Oh, also btw, if you need a specific number of React components, `Array.from(Array(x)).map((x, i) => <Star key={i}>)`

Ooo, also btw, just saw a really nice pattern for permissions from the EpocCam onboarding on iOS, it's the big interstitial process, but when they needed multiple permissions, they had just like one sentence showing saying that they were going to need both, and then the next screen had toggles with labels that were nice dark text and v. clickable, and as an app dev I was like, ah, this is so that the user is taking action to enable the permission _before_ you fire the native permission dialog. I just really wanted to click those toggles. Nice.

/// Wow, okay, rest of the day went pretty well, just reposted virtual garage sale content, I want to rebuild the site and then crash, tty tomorrow and best wishes! ~g
