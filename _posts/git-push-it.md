Good morning! Oh, wow, okay, what has happened the past few days? I've got to look back on it, but I don't think I've had two consecutive days where I didn't even hit 'new post' in a while. Oh, that'd be a fun little project, one sec ...

Aside, I just looked at the size of my git repo. Wwwhhooops. I committed my images, and it's massive, so _that's_ a to-do, goodness ... oh, wow, also just found out why there's a mysterious gap in my post list ... why on Earth would I write CSS like that, lol, used `display: grid;` on a component that shouldn't have been a grid at all. That's one of the things when you start from a starter, I've got components like MorePosts, PostPreview, HeroPost, but I'm not really sure I would have written them that way ... Oh YEA though, hopefully that looks better, simpler code, too. Blam.
