Good morning! Oh, wow, okay, what has happened the past few days? I've got to look back on it, but I don't think I've had two consecutive days where I didn't even hit 'new post' in a while. Oh, that'd be a fun little project, one sec ...

Aside, I just looked at the size of my git repo. Wwwhhooops. I committed my images, and it's massive, so _that's_ a to-do, goodness ... oh, wow, also just found out why there's a mysterious gap in my post list ... why on Earth would I write CSS like that, lol, used `display: grid;` on a component that shouldn't have been a grid at all. That's one of the things when you start from a starter, I've got components like MorePosts, PostPreview, HeroPost, but I'm not really sure I would have written them that way ... Oh YEA though, hopefully that looks better, simpler code, too. Blam.

Okay, GitHub-style frequency graphic, without looking at anything ... we'll need the little boxes to line up nicely, let's start with what we need from the posts data ... first I guess you need the date it starts and is up to (goodness, I wrote ends ... nono, not stopping, lol) maybe in an array so we can map over it and make boxes, so let's see ...

LOL I wrote BoxersWrap instead of BoxesWrap. Keep your shorts on, website!

Whoa, where did the time go? I'm going to have to shelve Project FrequencyGraphic for now, and maybe just push this post and some visual changes. To the future!
