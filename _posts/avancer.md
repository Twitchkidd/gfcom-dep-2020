Good morning! Must keep going! Up early, enjoying the weirdly warm weather (yikes.) Lot to do today, activing brain with MOOC!

Oh, I lost so many green boxes to not checking my MOOC code into git! Oh well, I've got an alias for it now.

Hoof, okay, we've MOOC'd, it's time to get Dawa some more fresh air before it starts raining here.
