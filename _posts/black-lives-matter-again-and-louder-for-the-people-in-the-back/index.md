Good morning! Didn't quite wake up to my 4:30 alarm, but better than yesterday, so let's do this. It's a cloudy, sometimes-raining type of day, so Dawa is chilled out, which is great because my ankle is really feeling it. Creating value time, go.

Lol, so I find myself _playing_ the game instead of developing it, so that's a good sign, lol.

Oh, no, though, lol ... as I go to deploy v0.0.1, I'm looking into the code for this very site, and what a train wreck. Ah, there it is though, in Layout, under /components. Oof.

// Yay! Zoey like it! It's still, like, awful, but let's get to a v0.0.2! I'm making issues on the repo!
