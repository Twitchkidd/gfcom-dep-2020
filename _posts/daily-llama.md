Good ... oh goodness, it's still morning, I was prepared for it to be afternoon. Up early today, and just waiting for a cup of coffee to cool down enough to drink. Dawa had a first walk and a bike ride and run around Fort Trumbull, and a moment at the park afterwards, and I think we'll probably want to go back out at some point, but for the moment, clickety-clack. Oh also this morning I finally got the dozens of things I'd had lined up for posting, posted, and the next thing on the docket is fixing the cards up ... I'm experiencing significant back pain already, wonder how the afternoon goes, lol.

Hah, that brightened things up a little ... I actually did that and didn't just imagine I'd done that ... running `yeet` in my terminal runs `yarn start`

/// Future Me: Not the most productive day! I mean, the first two hours were **super** productive, but the rest of the day got totally tanked by back pain, I didn't do anything of any value after noon. Ooof. To the future, then, and best wishes, ~g
