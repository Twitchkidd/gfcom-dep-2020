Good morning!

I seem to have broken my website this morning, hooray! // Oh good, yay dev tools, it was two chunks I'd forgotten ... sort of. They always show up on the 'deleted' list, not the 'updated' list with `npx @designory/build-diff` I'll just try to remember for next time, I'm not tracking down bugs right now, time to catch back up a little, mentally, and get myself situated for the week, here. Sorry, blog, for missing so many posts! I know when it's crazy is _especially_ when to keep writing, doing my best here though, I promise. To the future.

Or, to the immediate past really quick, what did I do this week?

So, right, the storage unit, that was a whole adventure, when was that ... Wednesday. It's Monday. My God.

I know it was Wednesday because the phone helpfully dates all the photos taken with it:

Then the next two days I put my place, my self, and my dog together, he was super needy the next day after I'd been gone, and my place was suddenly a mess again, but then Friday I ran Dawa 2.5 miles and then I got another 22.5 miles in, and I feel so much better for it. There's just something about running long, like I'd say a half marathon starts to hit that edge of running further than any sugar in the tank is going to get you, that's just so good for the mind.

And then related to coding, Alredo at Moodbit contacted me, and we had a video call Friday afternoon! I supposed I shouldn't divulge the deets, but very exciting, waiting on a call back! Also I've been keeping on going with the Java MOOC, that's been good. Oof, I was up in the middle of the night, let's see, not last night, Saturday night/Sunday morning, and decided to make a coffee and code and do some research on Microsoft Teams Apps ... note to self, don't do that again, lol. I made it through by just not having a later cup of coffee yesterday and letting myself crash early, and not letting myself open my phone again once I'd knocked out, so I feel line today. Also I was very productive yesterday in the normal morning hoursso I don't really feel bad, I kinda got done what I was trying to get done yesterday, and now I'm waiting on a call from 'Fredo and a call from this guy who wants to buy the tools!!! (Please buy all the tools, kind Craigslist person who sounded reasonable over the phone! lol ...) Oh, and I almost forgot about the laptop, was that Thursday? No ... yes? Yes. Dios Mio.

Yea, so, sold one of the MacBooks! I think it was the newer of the machines, and I meant to sell the other one, but silly me hadn't prepared it yet with a fresh OS install, and so it was taking forever, and I ended up just giving the dude the other machine. I'm actually pretty stoked on what he's working on, good luck dude!

Oh, it was Friday when I was out with Dawa when we saw the deer. Crazy! Wonder if I can get video to play here ...

Huh. Okay, brekkers, then we see whether it's stopped raining here, and then ... actually not super sure what then I've got options, but I haven't eaten yet and am starting to not think as clearly, so! To the future!

// It's the future! And I'm in the mood to MOOC!

/// It's far in the future, like the next day! Whoops! Peace and best wishes! ~g
