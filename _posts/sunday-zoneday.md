Yesterday I might have taken it easy, today I'm up early and ready to kick ass and name functions! Step one is reboot my React Native projects with what I learned yesterday about react-navigation 5: use it, don't lose it!

As a quick aside, if you're out there in the ether, Dave, miss you buddy. (Use it!) (I'm doin' it, Dave!) //

Okay, _well_ good start to returning to React Native ... Xcode wouldn't update until I **set the system time to October 19th, 2019** so it could update.

Still waiting for it to build ... woot. Helping a person on Reactiflux though, yay for that, and first sip of hot coffee for the day! Please kick in, lol. I made tea for our first walk today, (ooo the package manager just launched!!!) and sucked down the rest of the cold brew from yesterday with some granola and soy milk, nothing quite like hot coffee though.

So my goal here is to implement navigation (build succeeded!!!!!) for RunClub and Logoed, which I just sketched out. Let's try an iPhone 8 simulator rather than the iPhone 11 Pro Max, which my 2012 machine I think was struggling to launch, lol.

Still taking a while. In the meantime, let's do tabs in React with hooks! Thanks for the help here [Jetiss!](github.com/jetiss/tabs) ... Oh, this is a library ... eh, c'est la vie. Eh, you know, I'm going to look at the source and do it myself maybe. Or the coffee is going to totally overwhelm me, oh no, lol ... //

Yeap, took Dawa for a run, did some et cetera work, back at it though! In touch with my dude Oliwatobitowa, he's working through w3schools at the moment, and my dude at the dog park said that he'd do more with computers if he had a better laptop, so I'm seeing if I can't get my second machine running again ... ahh, okay, back to work on the React Native apps, the iPhone 8 simulator works much better on this, lol.

Omg, navigation is sooooo much nicer now! I took like, sum total (dog walk in-between) fifteen minutes to scaffold out a whole design, or at least the navigation through it, and it just worked, and my app feels like it has legs again. Holy moley. Let me try that with Logoed ... yea, this is going to be amazing. I'm so stoked. I'm also so tired, and I need to cook dinner for Dawa, and I should cook dinner for myself, too, but honestly I think snack foods are on the menu and winding down and passing out is on the docket. Good day!

Oh, and I ordered another hard drive because it was less than \$20, and if I can get this other computer working, maybe this other dude's life can get leveled up. I dunno, but like, I'm motivated to help others, and not so much else, except like ... I mean I'll do enough administrative stuff/playing the game so I won't get in trouble, hypothetically, and I'll do what I have to do to stay sane and have a good time, but beyond that, helping other people level up is like my main driver.
