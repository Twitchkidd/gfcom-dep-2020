Good morning! Long time no blog! The election.

I've got so many things I want to get done this morning before getting to any coding, I do just need to take a second to write out my thoughts on like, right now in time. Biden won the election, and thank goodness, but like seventy million people voted for Trump!

This is a lot of things ... like first of all, obviously this country has a serious problem and umm ... how do you have a functional country with that many people who'd vote for a total whackjob? If I was an international investor right now, my eyes would be drifting elsewhere. I almost made a 'side eye monkey puppet' meme of it ... too much, lol.

Okay neeext, that's like half of my fellow countrymen and women really explicitly hate me as a queer person. It's wonderful that so much diversity got voted in this year, and I want to feel hopeful ... really I just feel like there's so, so much work to do, and that we're not out of it at all, that the next calamity is probably happening right now ...

Just a few minutes ago, "feelin' fresh," aye?

// Mmm, forgot I'd made tea, perfect temp! Green tea with lemon and lemon ginger. üçµ

Welp, the music hasn't stopped, keep dancing.

Coding-side, I'm like one section away from finishing the first half of the MOOC, and I've got a project in mind for something to work on with my dev friend in LA, and of course this site is still very work-in-progress, and then there's `master-blaster` to revisit after that nice person did a code review of it, and I was halfway through learning TerminusDB and being able to add that and Docker to the resume, which will need updating, applications filled out, aaand you know what? I'm at least not totally paralysed with terror today. Solid two sighs of relief yesterday.

Okay, laundry, lemons, beans and rice, mash the soup, dishes take two, clothes in the drier, dog for a walk, maybe a bike ride and run, I should look at his paws ... also grooming ... anyway, photos of crystal stuff into sets to I can figure which is which and get them posted, site updated, and the whole time I also need to fight the back pain, lol, which started up immediately today. It was nice enough to wait until seven yesterday, but then it let me know it wasn't letting go, so I decided to bike Dawa to Bluff Point and make soup yesterday and last night so I'd be moving the whole time, and we made it through and now there's soup, time for work now though. Oofah, just chugged my tea. Let's goo!

Oh, coffee aside: this morning I opened a bag of Lavazza's Gran Aroma or however it's spelled, it's pretty good but not so good that I'm going to look it up, not gonna lie. Previous coffee was Veranda, pre-ground, but if it's on sale I can hardly ever resist the bright packaging, and it's _always_ of an acceptable quality. Before the Veranda, I'd gotten a pound of Colombian beans, medium-roast, from Muddy Waters, and that was actually surprisingly fresh, and neither of the coffee shops in town really have a light roast, but I'd take fresh beans over what Washington Street was selling, though to their credit that bag was _packed_ ... there's a reason a scale is like a mandated must-have if you're a food place selling things by the pound, at Starbucks we had to keep ours operational even though we never used it because if someone was getting coffee it was generally in preweighed bags, we'd sell people pounds or half pounds of the stuff behind the line really occasionally though, like if there was no more light roast, or if we had coffees you couldn't always get and it was a customer we favored, and it's like, here's a half-pound, we've got a half-pound button on the register, have a nice day, but I think if Tara ever saw anyone scoop a pound pag absolutely full and give it to someone for whatever a pound goes for, she'd be like, "Nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-no, whaaat are we doing?" and the customer may have gotten away with it once, if _Tara_ favored them, but you wouldn't forget the scolding.

Hot take, coffee should be ten bucks a cup, and thirty dollars a pound, and campesi√±os should be paid fairly.

En advance, toujours. Just in case, French is still the language of the revolution, right?
