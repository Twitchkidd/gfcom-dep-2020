Good morning! Been rocking and rolling for four hours already: productive day so far! Got the place ... well, more together, and the laundry should be finished now, got a workout in, did some planning, and I just finished the first real session of the MOOC! So exciting! No surprises from Java so far, just had to spend a second switching to VS Code instead of NetBeans. VS Code ftw.
