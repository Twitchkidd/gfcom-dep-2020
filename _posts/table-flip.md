Good morning! Weird mood. The kitchen is clean, but the wallet is empty. The photos and descriptions for a metric f#\$%-ton of marketplace posts are just about ready, though. Got a whole system here, actually kind of proud of that. Must keep going! I was uploading photos while I walked Dawa this morning, and I think we'll wait on adventure time until later, as it's cool enough today I don't think midday will be a heat challenge for us, and if I don't get all this posted I'm going to lose my mind. Might anyway. Consciousness: feeling cute, might delete later. To the future!

// It's the future! Dawa got a bike ride, and a run around Harkness, but not after I shifted a bunch of stuff and got put together, so after some lunch and a coffee I'm about to be working on, back to that mode, but I thought of some CSS for the website while I was biking, be a shame to not test it out. // Huh, there goes like an hour and a half. Nice, good stuff, though.
