Good morning! It's raining on Thanksgiving, and will be until late afternoon, looks like, and hopefully for the love of God people stay home, though of course reports aren't promising. What a nightmare. Here's a mug raised to 2021, leeeeehts get to work.

// Oof. I just put so much stuff on eBay. My back is killing me from sitting. Three and a half hour tutoring session last night, too. For the record, it made me sick to my stomach putting the crystal candy holder up for sale. Trying not to ugly cry right now. Onwards! Stick to the plan! On with it!

Hooray for the standing desk arrangement at least, if I kinda dance a little while I work I can keep going.

/// OMG Did I do it? I think that's all the listings I can make right now. Oh, my God. Email writing time.
