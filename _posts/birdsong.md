I said I would do it and I'm gonna do it. All of em. And I've got one track on repeat until I'm done, and I'm going to get it done tonight.

The song is Piano Joint, by Suff Daddy. It's on repeat, and I'm not going to let myself listen to anything else or look at anything other than this screen and the task at hand until it's complete, excepting my dog occasionally to get him to stop doing things and because he's adorable. He's been fed and walked, btw, he is fine. Got 3.75 mi in this morning, too, little champ.

The photos are the hard part. And naming the things. That part's done though, I think, though I still need to go through my phone to make sure I'm not forgetting anything, and make sure I clean up the heic folder, and run through high def to get out the like ten duplicates I just put in from the last conversion batch, match up with the spreadsheet, which has everything extraneous removed now at least, then get the thumbnails, then sort into Craigslist/eBay, and then go down the list, category, title, description, gut-check myself on the price I wrote down, put the urls into the spreadsheet, go through the reposts and reduce the prices and put the new urls into the spreadsheet, then build the site, write the email, and if we want to be extra, which we do, finish the most recent batch of scans and put _that_ picture in the email, and see if someone doesn't spring for the candy-holder, and in _any_ case it'll be _done with_ at least for the moment, until maybe this weekend I start photographing the next round of stuff, which will take much less time to get into the marketplaces this time, but until then I'll have dedicated time where I'm not anxious about the _stuff,_ and I will then focus on updating my resum√©, applying to jobs, continuing the coursework for CS2, of course there's tutoring tomorrow night if that works out, and we can think about fun things to do later, for the moment, Piano Joint is playing. I'm not even going to leave VS Code open, the bullet points here are going on paper and I can't open the editor again until I'm done.

This is probably (oh my God, the song started again, it's still playing) the last sentence of the post so good night and best wishes, ~g

/// OOOF Okay that lasted for two very productive hours and has to start again early tomorrow, I'm cooked. Cya tomorrow!
