description: "In which Gareth finally automates creating new posts!"
---

Good afternoon! The morning was spent on the script that automates making new posts, because believe it or not a few dozen times later I'm really tired of oping the editor, right clicking on blog and creating a folder, naming it, creating index.md in it, opening another blog post, copy-pasting the frontmatter over, changing the title, changing the date, changing the description ...

Enough. No more.

`gg`, `np` and I get prompted for a title and description, the answers are validated, there's a prompt for confirmation, and then the folder gets made, the file gets made, the frontmatter gets populated, and the project and file are opened in the editor.

I think the backup is just about done, too, where are we? I don't think I'm going to try to really keep the other laptop at parity, I think I can trust ... hmm ... ... I almost typed something that would have had my knuckles going for a knocking on the nearest wooden object ... well for the _moment,_ I'm going to trust Microsoft and Google with my data. Eep.

Anyway, trained hard the past few days, dog is happy, I think ... hanging in, here. Might add a post-script, in any case however,

Best wishes!
