Good morning! It's certainly later in the day than I'd have liked, but Dawa is handled, we got to Harkness and ... tried for running around the perimeter ... we got there eventually. Should be a cute photo in there somewhere! üê∂

I also feel really good about knowing what I need to do next, I have a schedule for the day and everything! And a half hour block for updating the website here, I realized I hadn't pushed any changes since fixing the grid lines, and also _where_ did I put that code for headerState? I know I actually wrote it, and am not just going crazy, because I _did_ reference headerState in the blog post, oh, huh, it's the one right above this one, alphabetically, "Four AM Vibin'".
