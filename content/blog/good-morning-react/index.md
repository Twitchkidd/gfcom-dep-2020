Good morning! It got bright and hot out quick this morning! Up nice and early, Dawa and I had substantial hanging out at the dog park time, and I got yesterday's post pushed, while out on the patio, but then my laptop became a very small bucket of lava, so we moved inside where it can at least not have to use power for the screen, as there's the dedicated work-space one. Looking forward to slightly cooler temperatures, not going to lie.

I guess the polar bears, too.

Anyway, on to programming :(

I just said on Twitter that I'd have my site pushed to Next by 3! WtF, PAST ME?! Why did you do that? TF!!! 😠 🐡 😅

Alright, let's try running it, then, where were we?

QotD isn't defined, needs to take in quote and attribution ... thanks to [html5doctor.com](https://html5doctor.com/blockquote-q-cite/) for the article about that, made good semantic choices with the quote of the day ✅ 📜

DelightButton ... honestly I thought I got to that one, maybe that was the last thing I was going to do yesterday before I couldn't sit and look at a screen anymore, lol.
