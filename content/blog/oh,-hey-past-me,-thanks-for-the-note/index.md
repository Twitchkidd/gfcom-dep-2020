Good morning! I didn't sleep all that well last night, but through the power of routines am somehow ready to rock and roll here, put together, the dog is wiped out from a run and is happy to have gotten a bike ride in, and I found a nice place to position one of my corkboards so I can have the notes from two and three days ago up, which was when I discovered that Past-Me had left me a note to "Plz gfcom-p-h thx."

... Well, then. Obviously meant something there ... and then it dawns on me that it's gfcom-public-html which I've been meaning to do a diff of the commits between builds for like ever.

Whoa.

So I've got this "Quiet Hours" playlist going, and there's this kinda hypnotic track playing, and `git diff HEAD^ HEAD` was scrolling by in the terminal, and something must have been minified, because a lot of comma-seperated seemingly random five- or six-character strings were going by, for like a while, and I was thinking the scene where he's looking at the code and seeing the Matrix, and I kind of zone out for a second waiting for it to finish catching up on the scrolling so I could exit and refine the diff to just give me files, and it switches to words and phrases, and for just a moment there I was like, oh, my God, it's happening.

It was not, that was plain English in markdown files, the diff was just scrolling through another file. Maybe someday Neo, lol.

Oh, `git diff --name-only SHA1 SHA2`, thanks ... 'Peter' on StackOverflow. In there with that name, nice. Wonder who that is.

Oh my God ... this is his bio, I kid you not, "I am not actually called Peter. Sorry about that." Hundred and six thousand reputation though, focus on git and then Ruby and Python.

Alrighty, sweet though, it's index.html, the folder with the blog post name, index.html in that folder, the folder in page-data/ of the blog post name, page-data.json in that folder, and rss.xml. I'll script that when I've got it in me to deal with string functions. I need a break from string functions. Let's see if this works, though ...

TESTING
