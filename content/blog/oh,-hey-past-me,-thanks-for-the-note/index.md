Good morning! I didn't sleep all that well last night, but through the power of routines am somehow ready to rock and roll here, put together, the dog is wiped out from a run and is happy to have gotten a bike ride in, and I found a nice place to position one of my corkboards so I can have the notes from two and three days ago up, which was when I discovered that Past-Me had left me a note to "Plz gfcom-p-h thx."

... Well, then. Obviously meant something there ... and then it dawns on me that it's gfcom-public-html which I've been meaning to do a diff of the commits between builds for like ever.

Whoa.

So I've got this "Quiet Hours" playlist going, and there's this kinda hypnotic track playing, and `git diff HEAD^ HEAD` was scrolling by in the terminal, and something must have been minified, because a lot of comma-seperated seemingly random five- or six-character strings were going by, for like a while, and I was thinking the scene where he's looking at the code and seeing the Matrix, and I kind of zone out for a second waiting for it to finish catching up on the scrolling so I could exit and refine the diff to just give me files, and it switches to words and phrases, and for just a moment there I was like, oh, my God, it's happening.

It was not, that was plain English in markdown files, the diff was just scrolling through another file. Maybe someday Neo, lol.

Oh, `git diff --name-only SHA1 SHA2`, thanks ... 'Peter' on StackOverflow. In there with that name, nice. Wonder who that is.

Oh my God ... this is his bio, I kid you not, "I am not actually called Peter. Sorry about that." Hundred and six thousand reputation though, focus on git and then Ruby and Python.

Alrighty, sweet though, it's index.html, the folder with the blog post name, index.html in that folder, the folder in page-data/ of the blog post name, page-data.json in that folder, and rss.xml. I'll script that when I've got it in me to deal with string functions. I need a break from string functions. Let's see if this works, though ...

TESTING ... Hooray! Much better than selecting all files and folders in and ftp GUI and then _unselecting_ the ones you don't want deleted. Honestly I think I lost a folder at some point along the road here, lol. cgi-bin/, did I need that? I hardly ever look at the Apache stuff on the server.

I'm going through a bag of light roast at the moment, which is not the freshest, it's pre-ground, but at least it's a light(ish) roast, and was on sale. I'm not sure whether I want another hot cup of that or a cold cup of a coffee marketed as good for cold brew that my sister gave me, (thanks Elsbeth, we'll talk soon!) but I think I'll keep letting the A/C do it's thing and go for the hot coffee, in the hopes that Dawa will really not need atention for a while if at least it's cool in here. AWW he just went and found a blanket to snuggle up in, bless his little heart.

Okay, coffee made, back to it, I need to do other things right now, but TODO on scripting that last thing up, and ready set go.

Huh, well known dev tool Anaconda's website is broken from 768px width to 991px. I'm throwing no stones here, to be clear, my website is broken at any device width, just funny to see the web being broken sometimes. Oh, no, it's their enterprise page too, not just their individual page. Oh well, I get the feeling anyone who's maybe an Anaconda customer would understand about browsers if they were using a tablet in that range. Time to eat the frog, though.

Yay, frog eaten! There was an email I was hesitating tackling, but I made myself an outline and handled it. Phew! Weight of ye olde shoulders, ya know. And uhh, [link to "Eat The Frog",](https://blog.noisli.com/what-it-means-to-eat-the-frog/) an approach to getting things done. (Apparently named for a Twain quote, who knows.)

> [As Mark Twain once said “If it’s your job to eat a frog, it’s best to do it first thing in the morning. And if it’s your job to eat two frogs, it’s best to eat the biggest one first.”](https://blog.noisli.com/what-it-means-to-eat-the-frog/)

Okay, moving on, this one job wanted Pandas, so maybe I'll just learn that real quick. That's the attitude you've got to have, the title of the posting looks perfect, but the first line they need Pandas, I mean, how hard could it be? We're coding, right? Let's do this!

WHOA Anaconda is cool! Oh, sick, also the icon overlays the Android Studio logo to give you this:

Oh, but I forgot images aren't working right now, lol. Wah-wah. Soon. First Pandas, lol. Oof, actually though, first moving my body, I was just sat down for a while and my back said nope :\ / :)

/// Oof, that turned into a whole adventure. I'm exhausted. To pick up from before, first resumé, _then_ Pandas, oh and also, how many animal names can I stuff into my resumé? Python, Pandas, Anaconda ... oh, there are less than I was thinking, at least among the easily googleable ones. _Total_ aside though, there's a [pythonforbiologists.com!](pythonforbiologists.com) Interesting! I miss mathy stuff like this! Okay, exhaustion is setting in, bon soir and best wishes! ~g
