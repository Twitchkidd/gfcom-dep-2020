Good morning!

☕ It's coffee time!
💻 And coding!
🐶 Dawa's handled!
🏃‍♂️ Let's go!

### Main Content Layout

The main content grid needs to adapt to how the markup changes between the mobile and desktop versions.

// Whoa, got sucked into it for a while there, my coffee got cold, and that's nothing to say about the coffee. Dave's Roastery, Blind Pig Blend. Decent stuff. Fresh enough beans at least, and it's got a bit of pop to it.

Just busted out so much React! I had the whole markup in HTML for mobile and desktop, now the mobile is converted, even if the components haven't been fleshed out yet, and the state for mobile/desktop is set up ... it's been a few hours, though, that's about what I can do for the moment, breakfast and walking Dawa again need to happen. 😃
