Good morning! Clocking in at 4:30 today! I ... oh no ... does ... he does. Goddamnit, back in a bit.

SWEET, FIVE AM VIBIN', LET'S DO THIS. CSS grid time.

Sweet, grid is awesome. Maybe overkill for what I'm doing, I want to train my thinking in line with the latest, though.

Hmm. Why is mobile null? Oh, wtf ... this is one of those times where it doesn't work and I don't know why, and then I change something and it works, and I don't know why. Literally added a console.log() in there and what do you know? isMobile.current gets assigned in the useEffect. No console.log()? No assignment. Is JavaScript exiting the function because of an error? This has something to do with useRef maybe, because I'm just calling it rather than passing null, and now it works on the first render, but not if there's headerState in localstorage?

Ohhhkay, just about there with this, and what we learned is that if you have a lot of logic, figure it out before coding, lol. I think maybe I thought that there wasn't as many if statements we'd need for this. A hundred lines to start out with and not really correct to ... 135 lines, 107 aren't comments. Woof, that took way too long. Mad at myself just a little, lol. Maybe I'm still not caught up on sleep though, is what I'm thinking. Time to put myself together and get Dawa out for a run!

Ahhh, jk, I remembered to test it and it's not working :(
