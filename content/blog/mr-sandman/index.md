Good morning! It's super hot out! Also, still not a whole lot of that sleep thing going on! I'm sure I hit REM at one point, because I was dreaming, I think that's how it works, right? Anyway, my brain knows it's on this side of a night's ... rest, at least. I've got a plan, though, the plan involves me getting some work done here, though, so let's hop to it. Dawa is taken care of, though he thinks he wants another walk right now. We went out on the patio for a little bit, we definitely don't want a walk right now. Got to Harkness today, since I ... I don't want to call it "sleeping" in, but I didn't get up until six thirty today, which, accounting for a first walkies, means that twenty minutes from when we start biking is eight o'clock, when Harkness opens. I really prefer it if I'm not really up for technical single-track trail, which today I'm really not, still recovering from running around with my niece after a pretty decent trail run with Dawa on Saturday, plus the like, not so much with a rest or a break, and the plan for moving forward is to add another run/workout in in the evening ... wish me luck, lol!

Alright, website time. It rendered, which is nice feedback to get when you spend, you know, whatever it was, eight to ten hours between design and authoring, that you aren't totally off your rocker as far as markup and rendering logic go. I wonder if I should approach the CSS from an inside-out or outside-in perspective? Like, I could start with the small components and then when it's time for the whole thing's layout, it'll have that wow factor, or I could start with the outer layout and drill in, promising speed but the temptation to not get to the polish ...

Oh man, falling asleep standing up, that's no good, lol. I just drank coffee. Great coffee, actually, thanks to my wonderful sister! I just remembered, from earlier actually, I was pushing Dawa up the first hill out of here this morning and I almost fell asleep walking. ... Okay, fixed the Gatsby Link components, they just needed '/about' or whatever, not the whole url.// Got myself together, I'm falling asleep standing here. I think I'm going to bust a quick mission, try to get a nap in, and then give it another shot here. Just going to add a few things to AppWrap that I thought of in the shower though ... oh, the custom paddings and everything for that funky look the old layout had, that can go now, yay, lol! I'm glad that's in the git history.

/// Next day, post-mortem:

Ooohkay, so that ... kind of worked. I did get a nap in, got up, made herbal tea, took Dawa to the park for a bit, and I did go for a run, but I was _not_ able to get any work done afterwards, just too tired still.

Well, to the future, best wishes,
