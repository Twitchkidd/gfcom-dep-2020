Oof, I didn't even finish my post on Thursday and didn't post at all yesterday! Shame on me! Got a lot of cleaning done yesterday, not so much with the coding, only a little bit starting the gathering of requirements for the can-we-be-done-with-node-for-a-moment push. This tea is quite good though, let's do this thing.

(Posting live because I hopefully figured out not being able to compile the project!)
