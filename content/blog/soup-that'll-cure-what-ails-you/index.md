Good morning! Really struggling with the back thing today! It's been more than a week since I've had a day where I didn't record a Strava activity, and I thought today I'd get a break, but Dawa was whining, and so we went back out and after I let him sniff around for a while I took him on a mile and a half run, and then we hung out at the park with another couple dogs for a bit, ... he's just started panting heavily in the corner. I'm going a little nuts here. He's already eaten and there's clean water in his bowl. And been brushed. We need a new squeaky toy, the current ones are too low on flavor. Active noise cancellation headphones time. though.
