I had no idea what to call today's adventure, but the soundtrack is "Live At The Blue Note: Mac Gollehon's Smoking Section" so we're going for it!

I'm going to be helping someone from Nigeria learn JavaScript! His name is Oluwatobiloba, and we connected through Twitter! [Give him a follow!](twitter.com/TTmovic) //

So this morning I cleaned the apartment, so I'm definitely in a better headspace to be able to code, even with the tweaker yelling curses outside. Next thing I'm going to work on is getting through the [`react-navigation` version 5 tutorial by Handlebar Labs](https://www.reactnativeschool.com/master-react-navigation-v5) because I haven't touched React Native in a minute and this is like essential, and it's a Saturday and I slept in and don't feel like doing career stuff, so there :p

Oh the API is so much better! Also, yay, I didn't lose my React Native chops, and totally guessed how to call the `toggleDrawer` function correctly! // Aaand done! I will call today productive! (And try to work more later, let's see though, lol) ... /// (Didn't happen, cya tomorrow morning though!)

Best wishes, ~g
