Good morning! I'm listening to "You'll Never Walk Alone" after listening to The Anthropocene Reviewed earlier, and ... I'm not crying, you're crying!

Alrighty, let's do it to it. // Yay all my files are finally backed up, lol. Next up is to take the hard drive out and secure the cable under it, which hopefully doesn't break it, but I have another machine, just in case, lol. Then will be "What do I do with the Run Club project?"

So I feel like, instead of starting by making decisions about either trying to get the current code how I'd like it, take a trip back to design-land, or upgrade to React and go from there, the right way to get myself to actually do this thing rather than faffing about for eternity is to put on the business hat and walk through what actually treating it like a product I'm going to release. When I've got deadlines (balanced with applications and all the other job-getting activity,) then I'll put the coding hat on again. For the moment, let's see if I break my laptop, lol.
