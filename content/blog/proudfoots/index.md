Lol and good morning! Got Dawa out on a trail run again this morning, just having my second cup of coffee before putting myself together, and I really want to solve the header problem really quick because I was thinking about it trying to fall asleep last night, but really quick, I just saw this commit message, `Add a footer so that content does not abruptly end` and that makes so much sense!

Okay, so MoreLessButton is going to be floating between the headers, meaning it's going to be absolutely positioned and needs to know how many headers are open at the time, and then if the user closes any headers, start saving state to localStorage so they don't have the headers open next time. Forgot to mention check if there's ... what are we calling this ... headersCount? headerCount? Names are hard! Okay well it's counting headers, but you count pages, too, but you don't say pagesCount, you say pageCount, it's implied by count that page may be plural.

`headerCount`.

// Alrighty, coding from Fort Trumbull! I've got half an hour or so before Elsbeth and co. are supposed to be here, so I can ... oh back, please cooperate. It kinda works if I don't really look at the screen, or use just my eyes, but it's so tempting to lean forward ... which I can do if I'm writing in English, I don't know about JSX though.
