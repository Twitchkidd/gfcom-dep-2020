I can't believe I've ever typed like this in this apartment, why on Earth? I'll know what I meant here. Lo siento.)

Also, I need to document my code.

..

And experience of the editor?

I typed cmd+f for find, typed in 'repositories',
and it pulled up all the matches in the file,
but then I typed cmd+sft+f because I thought
that might be how to find all exact matches,
it pulled up all the matches in the _project!_

Are you ... are you kidding mm ... aaahh! _THAT_
is where that shortcut lives? I maybe just thought
somehow if it was my own code I would know which
files to go to or some crap?! No! CMD+SFT+F and SEARCH PROJECT!

I didn't actually need that right then, though, lol, to be clear.
Just one file at the moment, and it's maage=

/// Much later ... forgot to close this one off I guess, lol! Best wishes! ~g
