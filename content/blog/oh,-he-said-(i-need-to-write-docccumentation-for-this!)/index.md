I can't believe I've ever typed like this, why on Earth? My pup is happy, though he needs a bath, but not so much that it can't wait for tomorrow right before a midmorning walk, to take advantage of the evaporative cooling. I didn't run him today after checking his paws, so I got six miles in myself, and then _so_ much good coding. I mean comparatively, not objectively, I know I'm extremely mediocre at this stuff, but after I run I can kinda do the thing! It's nice. It was too hot for Dawa thog

Until the back pain kicks back in! It's been way better now it's a few days after I moved,
