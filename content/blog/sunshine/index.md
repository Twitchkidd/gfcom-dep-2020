Good morning!

The puppy dozes peacefully, at some point I've got to get a run in, first I want to go over my notes from yesterday and start a page going ...

I wonder if people ever ship js that's writing over the css just to back it up, lol. Now that I've been reading more BEM-style code I think I could go with that. It is kinda wordy, but not like, reaaalllyyy.
