Good ... afternoon! I took the morning to get some things over to my sister's and train, I'm all set though, Dawa's all set, just got some food in me, have some tea here, fabuloso! Next up is finishing off making sure my machine is backed up before I write those database queries, and then actually I need to do a little planning before that so I can have a better picture of what I'm doing here. I had a plan a few weeks ago, and it's been a good few weeks, I think I'm a little off the rails, though. Memorial day was yesterday, feels like a great time to dive in headfirst!

.. Lol which I did! Downloading upgrades and backing things up was apparently not much to write home about though.

Best wishes!
