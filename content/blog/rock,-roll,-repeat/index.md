Gooood morning! Dawa and I got out on a bike ride to Stenger Park after our first walk again today, and he got to run around with some huskies after running the trail with me, and we're ready to work at 9:15 here, and he'll be good for a long while today, so not bad. I'm drinking some cold brew made with a blend specifically made for it, it's crazy good. I haven't had black iced coffee that tasted _sweet_ like that, I don't think ever, this is really some good stuff.

Next up is Reactifying this layout, and since my build broke and I suspect just like, everything needs updating, I'm going to start from a new templete and build the site up from that again. Just like with React Native, it's often better just to blow the project away and start again, with all the dependencies that go into these projects. One of the nice thing about Python, that a lot was built in, but I was doing different stuff with it, and it's great that web technologies can evolve so quickly.
