Good morning! Alrighty, must focus. I'm actually just getting around to writing after a few rounds, I've got a little tech demo set up, I've had a run and two coffees, Dawa will probably need a walk soon here, so let me see if I can blast through this, I really want to try this react-wordcloud library out, and feed it my blog posts here, lol. Could be good.

I've got like eighty things open right now, not really eighty, but it feels like it, because like I'll go down a rabbit hole and I'll do as good a job being thorough on the way back ... okay, no dig! Lol! Finish the ten little projects you set yourself up for, go!

/// Whoa ... okay, so, I can't look at code anymore. I so don't really _need_ to do this word-cloud thing, but I should really get more familiar with this kind of map-reduce thing. Right now, the next step when my head is on straight again is to make sure I have it very clear where the asynchronous calls are being made. Got a functioning reducer for one file, just need to map over the files now. Got the files, too. Woot. Good night!

And best wishes!
