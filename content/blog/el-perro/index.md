Good morning! I've been up since 5:30 and moving pretty optimally, Dawa and I got out for a first walk, then for a bike ride and trail run, and now we're at the dog park and I'm about to finally be able to get some work in, I hope, lol. It's just such an effort to be back to the house at 8 having biked miles across town towing him, and then dragging him on a trail run, which to be fair really is only until we get into the groove, then he does great, and his little paws are showing good texture, so the plan is working, but then I have to tow him back, get put together, and then he's like in my face for more attention, and about at the end of my rope here, but there's coffee at least, and hopefully I can escape into some headphones soon here.

Okay, morning meeting with myself time, what's on the docket ... okay, got my files here, bio is partly deconstructed, layout is set up once I'm ready for CSS, working on index, up to Sidebar on mobile.

Okay, here's the last commit before main got rewritten `9bf4ca9b9470934b5063c70893bed3968d4fd0bb` ...

Oh, lord, that's what's going on with the tabs. I forgot how crazy that was to set up. Okay, umm ... DepNav, right, I renamed it. This thing needs wiring up a certain way, though.
