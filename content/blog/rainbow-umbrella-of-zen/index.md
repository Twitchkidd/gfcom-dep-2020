Good morning! Everything was going so well, too. Maybe it won't be so bad. Maybe I can pull everything from 1.0.3 on Pypi (which is super-exciting by the way! Pypiii!!!)

Oh, it's a) okay, but also b) not great right now. The dev branch is on Pypi. Whoooops.

JK though on all that work being gone though! Yay!

The other computer died again though, lol, boo.
