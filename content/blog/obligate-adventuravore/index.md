Good morning! Oh good, it is morning still! I actually slept in a little today, latest all month at 7:30, I think I'm a little caught up though, and ready to rock and roll this coming week. Today, too, looking forward to seeing how much I can bust out today. Dawa did _not_ want to go for a run this morning, not in this heat, and especially after I got him out on one yesterday in the evening, so I figured that meant I should go double, and busted out another half marathon. Yay! I think I should take Dawa out just briefly here, though, because it's been a few hours. He just needs to experience that yes, it's in fact bloody miserable out and that the A/C is our friend, lol. The temptation is also for my hips to lock up if I just sit right now, as much as I don't want to do anything. I've got some of my buddy's kombucha in me though, and that little kick, can definitely feel it! So tasty, too! Blueberry!

// Alrighty, Dawa's all set, I remembered where I put that markup I wrote for the next part on the home page ...

/// Uhh, well, got a little work in, my body informed me it needed to rest though, and whether I was on board with this just meant I was either resting on the sofa or passing out in my work chair.

It was all work it to have some legit no-stress walks with Dawa. I'll be waking up early tomorrow, without the need to do a major exercise, hopefully. Lord, I sweat buckets today. Allright, though, Dawa is fed and walked, I've had a curry, am exhausted, and am going to flip the little switch on my back to turn off. Big week ahead! Best wishes! ~g
