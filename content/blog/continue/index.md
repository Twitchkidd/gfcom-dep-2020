Good morning! I'm going to jump right into it, because after spending four and a half hours tutoring someone in React last night, I feel like I need to race to get my place back here. I'd just ... what did I do ... set up Mongo? Yea, the server was talking to Mongo, I think I was halfway through how to update documents with the NodeJS driver ... Oof, _one_ step back though, I kept on having to look up how to do basic things and look up how class components looked, lol. Yay programming. Yea, as I close my tabs, this.handleChange.bind(this), what's the syntax and where do you put it ... How to use fetch to update state in a class component ... Do we need to use super() or super(props) in the constructor ... **What are the attributes of an input, type 'text', lol**

Okay, that one I think I knew, and was just showing them the docs at MDN. They were super smart, totally followed along with the concepts I was going over pretty quickly, brought correct terminology back around later in the conversation, and again, we were rocking and rolling for four and a half hours straight there, and you could tell they didn't have a whole lot of experience with like, typing, much less the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, git, CLI, and React parts. I did my best, I really hope they do well!

OKAY MONGO TIME, DO NO MORE PROCRASTINATING.

Yay, I'm on fiyah this morning! ðŸ”¥ Also I feel like the Mongo driver docs just played me into Googleing, "What's upsert?" ... "Not much man, what's up with you? (Says Sert)"

Okay, sweet, tutorial time over, make stuff time. // Ooohkay, so I clearly need to restructure the routes and the connection, but I'm going to take a break, do some dishes, walk Dawa, and come back to this with a fresh mind.

Oh, eff it, it's @wesbos time. I can't _really_ afford this, but I can buy it, and I need a little boost right now. #learnNode!

Okay, if my internet could come back, that would be great. ... Thank you hotspot!

// Dang, nature, you scary! It's crazy out there, the busted gutter I told them about in Febuary got blown off the roof, the rain is coming in through the (closed) patio door, trees all gone cray, hod'dan'!

Anyway, so I applied for five jobs today, and it was all **terrifying!** I ended up going back to the Node course, and I'm like a fifth of the way through. The templating language is weird! I guess pug/jade is popular, but whooaaa so weird!
