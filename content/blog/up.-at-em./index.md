Good **morning!** Up early again today, Dawa is walked, let's do this!

I think most of the loopy-doos are in place, just needs organizing before I can move onto the next issue, which should be pretty meaty!

// Whooof! It's a little more imperative than I'd like, but it's getting there! I bet this thing will be seven hundred lines of code, I'm going to shoot for that. I really want to do some dishes or something ... put myself together ... // Okay, dishes done, self put together, Dawa got a little time at the park, got some brekkers and a coffee, back at it!

///

Good morning on the 7th! I haven't been writing, so I figured I'd jump back in! Sooo close to finishing `master-blaster`! It's been non-stop, just trying to do the best I can with Dawa, and take care of myself, and code, and I kid you not this thing is so close to done! Or done enough for a v1!

All I have left to do is enter in what needs to be logged to the logfile, give the user more feedback as that's happening, and when the repos and branch requests are going on, and at the end, though the whole process there can be improved tremendously, but then I'm going to write in some warnings and document how to use the thing and exactly what it does, look further into freezing it and other packaging things, review the copy one more time, and push! GO!

Oh, and handle the patch response.
