I love that idea of part of me being robo-Gareth. If I have a comic where I wear different hats throughout the day by being different characters, robo-Gareth is definitely in there.

Anyway, I'm blocking out a good chunk of time here ... hahaha ... I wrote chuck ... he's character #4 of the Run Club test data, so I'm #1, and then I'm using Alice, Bob, Chuck, Dave, Eve (the evesdropper) all down the security/cryptography chain of characters, until Judy for the moment, lol ... anyway, I've got a good chunk for coding here, and I'm going to start by picking something in a different direction entirely! Okay maybe ... twenty minutes unless I decide I'm going to reorganize ~/Code, and then thirty minutes to work on data and that, from the next hour, in two minutes, 11, go!

Wow, my ~/ScreenCaps is over 50mb, should probably try the TimeMachine things again after cleaning my hard drive, holy moley!

Okay, so maybe like 40 minutes, and I know where I'll pick up next time, which is to try and make a react app that counts the pages! Next segment should be what's eating at my mind, which is acceptBudsRequest with strings, which should not be causing me that much stress, but there we have it, lol.
