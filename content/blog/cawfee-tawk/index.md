Good morning! Let's jump right in, I'd already got going and have the fonts and typography uhh ... sort of back. I forget what I did last time around to handle links doing that thing, and I tried the overrides from [Jose Felix's post](https://dev.to/joserfelix/how-to-make-a-static-blog-with-next-js-2bd6) as is and they don't work for my fonts, so a few little changes there and going back over the Gatsby site again, and then I've got a big-ole kanban set up with what I need to launch this thing, leh go.

// Okay, so, let's hear it for having multiple machines! I brought the main machine outside, and it was great, I could see, but it was like a brick out of an oven after a while, lol. Let's hear it for git and the web, too, while we're at it, git push, git pull, open the tabs I had open, bada bing, bada boom. Crazy.

Being able to see was great though, oof, lol, bright out here in the morning! // Lol the sun also turned the backup machine into a small furnace, time for inside mode!

Oh, yea, there's that little bit of quirkiness in the text!

Got through the footer content, on to header content ... what a mess, the way this thing is organized is driving me nuts ... That's next on the digital todos, it's physical todos time now! I'd love to go for a run, it's beautiful out, but I really need to get a few things done around the house and when the place is put together, I have a phone call I need to get through, and I'm going to get groceries, do some meal prep, and get back to digital todos this evening! Love the progress so far!

/// Wow okay, place is clean, phone call situation handled, tune in for part two tomorrow morning, lol, bunch of applications out while walking to/from groceries using the LinkedIn app, totally sent the wrong resume to the first company, and they looked perfect, whoops, but I also got the component hierarchy all mapped out and I can fix it now.

Maybe a todo, the Next template uses a fragment instead of null, is this safer or something? Oh, apparently null is suggested by the React team ... what's with this then? Whatever, anyway ...
