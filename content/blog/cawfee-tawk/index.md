Good morning! Let's jump right in, I'd already got going and have the fonts and typography uhh ... sort of back. I forget what I did last time around to handle links doing that thing, and I tried the overrides from [Jose Felix's post](https://dev.to/joserfelix/how-to-make-a-static-blog-with-next-js-2bd6) as is and they don't work for my fonts, so a few little changes there and going back over the Gatsby site again, and then I've got a big-ole kanban set up with what I need to launch this thing, leh go.
