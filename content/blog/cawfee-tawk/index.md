Good morning! Let's jump right in, I'd already got going and have the fonts and typography uhh ... sort of back. I forget what I did last time around to handle links doing that thing, and I tried the overrides from [Jose Felix's post](https://dev.to/joserfelix/how-to-make-a-static-blog-with-next-js-2bd6) as is and they don't work for my fonts, so a few little changes there and going back over the Gatsby site again, and then I've got a big-ole kanban set up with what I need to launch this thing, leh go.

// Okay, so, let's hear it for having multiple machines! I brought the main machine outside, and it was great, I could see, but it was like a brick out of an oven after a while, lol. Let's hear it for git and the web, too, while we're at it, git push, git pull, open the tabs I had open, bada bing, bada boom. Crazy.

Being able to see was great though, oof, lol, bright out here in the morning!
