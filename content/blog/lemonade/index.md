GOOD MORNING! I got like an hour and a half of sleep last night, and the coffee definitely has not hit yet, but my day light was set for earlier than yesterday, I'm up, let's do this!

Huh, I thought I fixed photos ... oh, wow, my Gatsby config file is _all_ messed up, there's nested plugins declarations. I don't know how it builds at all, lol. Good job, Gatsby, and Gareth, what the hey? Okay, I need to prioritize, though, omg and Dawa just stretched lying on his side he's the cutest ... ahem! Prioritize! Gatsby config file gets turned into an issue, let's get this React written. Go!

Oh, no, Dawa is awake and needs attention for the next two hours, lol. Effff.
