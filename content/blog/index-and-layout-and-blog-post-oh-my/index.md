Good morning! Somehow it's still morning! I was up early today, got Dawa out, and then instead of taking him for a bike ride I went for a long run, which my legs were kinda not ready for, but I started back up after a walking break and made it home, then worked in the park a little with Dawa hanging out with his buds, he was pretty chill, I took him for an afternoon run yesterday on top of his usual morning run, which included socialization and sprints yesterday. I thought about what I needed to do with the code on the run today, now I just need to bust this out. Pen and paper time, though, I was looking at it at the park and I think I know the todo list I need to make, but concentrating there was less than ideal, due to nearby construction and being right on the, albeit relatively quiet, road, so now I'm back inside and Past-Me left Future-Me (and Dawa) air conditioning, thanks Past-Me!

Now on with the show!

Here's how it looks at the moment:

Oh, sweet, dude, I didn't even notice that I broke the whole little tabs thing I had going on there. Yyyea, site overhaul long overdue. Mobile was never really even accounted for except for what came with `gatsby-starter-blog` ... let's wrangle this spaghetti monster in.

Bio takes in location, then if it's root it returns a fragment with either a wrapper with an Image and a p tag with a links saying follow me on Twitter or hire me, lol, or a ... slightly differently styled wrapper with an Image and a p tag with a link saying follow me on Twitter. Info about the author and the Twitter account, as well as the source of the Image, come from a useStaticQuery call. Bio is rendered as the first non- react-helmet component inside Layout from index.js, and inside a footer in blog-post.js, right above the navigation. Inside Layout. ðŸ¤®

Index takes in location and data from a page query, then it ... oh, how sad is that greyed-out import statement up there, I meant to do something better for mobile, lol. Okay, well, it returns Layout with location and a title that comes from data, then the whole home page, passing the whole data object through to BlogList, in the coding panel. It used to handle state regarding tabs, I don't know what happened.

Moving on to blog-post, which takes in location, data, and pageContext, and returns a Layout with location and title (from data,) Seo with stuff from data, which I realize I hadn't mentioned in the previous paragraphs, but they were there, and an article and nav, populated with data and pageContext, also including Bio in the article, with location.

Now Layout, which imports Global, and takes in location, title, and children, then checks if location is root before defining Header as either a LandingHeadingWrapper with an h1 with the title, and the hamburger, or an h3 with the title, then it returns a fragment with Global, then checks if location is root and either LandingMainDiv or OtherMainDiv with the same contents, a header tag with Header, a main tag with children, and a footer.
