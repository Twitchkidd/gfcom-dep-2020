Good morning! Dawa got a mile around the block this morning, then I got five and a half barefoot, did some solid design work on the next version of garethfield.com, and got my work stuff sorted out from my personal stuff, except for small notes, paperwork-wise, and now I'm going to see what I can do about implementing this layout. I'm pretty stoked, I made some considerations for mobile that I'm looking forward to seeing come alive. Let's see if I can bust this out, too.

Going with the Chakra UI library for a little visual polish, so far so good ...

Hmm, nevermind. I want to work with just html/css and `styled-components`. `react-template` time.

Oh wow! I hadn't looked at the code I'd written for this Gatsby site since I whipped it up in ... March? March. Lol I looked at the git log rather than the last post on the posts list, which never got paginated or anything lolll just been crankin'! I put so much love into it, at the time, but it just really is not how I'd set things up if I were to do it over right now. Also I think the build broke, lol.
