Good morning! Today is going pretty well so far, I had an uninterrupted night's sleep last night, which is **bonkers**, up bright and early and made green tea instead of coffee first thing, we're going to pretend that the second, longer walk with Dawa was blissful and soothing and that I have no worries whatsoever, for the moment. I've got a coffee now, Dawa's lying down and has stopped panting, and I'm listening to an artist named Saib, who if you haven't heard of, go listen immediately and just leave it on. So chill.

Coding time! Since the main machine is upgrading its operating system, I'm on the backup, and I'm sure it was up-to-date at some point yesterday, but I pulled in any changes, and wow, yea, that was about right, I wrote somewhere in the five to six hundred lines of code range. The next part isn't going to be as volumnuous, just a bit more difficult. Let's go!

Lol, of course an 800 number calls me right then. Getting real cozy with that feeling of not being able to make any headway, lol. Right, keep going!
