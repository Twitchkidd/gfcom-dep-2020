Good morning! Alrighty, so I wanted to get right to it today, lot to do. To the future!

// Phew, okay, so I finished the Next JS tutorial, super interesting! I'm pretty stoked to port this over. `gatsby-starter-blog` does a lot, but Next is great, from my very limited experience, lol, less convoluted by a lot. I bet things could get out of hand pretty quickly, mais c'est la vie.

Oh yea, why am I doing this? Check [this thread out!](https://twitter.com/tesseralis/status/1293649007739191296) I remember when Gatsby just came out, sorry to hear it turned into a "frat-boy company". Big oof notation, here, oof(n).

Okay, so we need a try-catch for the JSON parse call, and then I guess I should do some planning before just diving in to a major refactor :)
