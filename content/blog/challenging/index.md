Good morning! I'm not having a great mental health day, but I'm here at the park with Dawa, he's just chillen, not really though because it's hot with 100% humidity. I've got to get a little work done or I'm going to go absolutely nus, though. So, let's write some CSS!

... because CSS is the _least_ frustrating languages ...

Whoops, didn't write for a while! I got some administrative things done today that I'd been meaning to do, blew a bunch of lines of CSS out and got some structure ready for a push early tomorrow, and Dawa got as much outside time as we could manage, with the heat. I was pretty low yesterday and earlier today, I'm looking forward to the future again though!

I wonder if I forgot to push a commit on the other machine, the file names I changed haven't changed on this one ...
