## About To Go Frontend Mode

Finishing up polishing off some backend tasks, and I'm going to go into frontend mode soon! So exciting! I know my website looks like hot garbage right now, it's been nice to have a place to just write in my blog every day and put it out there on the internet, and almost hopefully no one will see it, but at least I know it's like, out there. You know what I mean. ðŸ˜†
