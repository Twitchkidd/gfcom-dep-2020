Skipped a lot of day there before checking back with ye ole blog! Run accomplished and major resume overhaul! Ever read something you wrote and feel sure that you remembered getting to an acceptable level of done-ness, but having read it again can only ask, \"I wrote this?\" I mean, in programming, too though, right? I looked back to my first project folders from 2015, and not stuff I'm super proud of, lol. Looking forward to the next refactor/editing, the next piece of work is authoring though, I need to write a cover letter.</p>\n<p>Okay, let's think of what variables there will be ... my values will align with each company a little differently, so there's some room there for why me and company BCD are a good fit ... then there's the tech, I'll be more-or-less aligned with companies there ... and then there's like, whether I feel like any color matters, or whether bog-standard is the way to go.</p>\n<p>Lol, tweaker-man is having an all-out fit out there. Right, well, I missed writing about a lot from earlier, but that I got the resume totally re-done is huge, and I don't know how much more I'm going to get done tonight, and I haven't posted for a few days, so I'm going to save and try to post and if I write more I'll update.</p>\n<p>Best wishes!\n~g</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
