Trying to think about programming or design right now, like wtf ... okay, I need my head in the game, though, or what good am I?</p>\n<p>Rebuilt my Linode because I couldn't ssh in. Starting again with <a href=\"https://www.linode.com/docs/development/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs-and-nginx-on-debian-10/\">how-to-install-nodejs-and-nginx-on-debian-10</a> ... domain name, dns records ... oop, rebuilding the Linode didn't fix my ssh problem. ####.</p>\n<p>Alright, nuked it, we'll try again ... I'm going to punt, too, and try their one-click install of the MERN stack. Like ... if it works, why not? Whole idea behind having an actual box anyway is if I need to I can get in there.</p>\n<p>Okay, sweet, not locked out of my own box anymore. That was so frustrating.</p>\n<p>Not convinced my hosts file is right. Blah. Added 127.0.1.1 lkjhalsdkjfhalsdkjfhlaksdjhfasdlkjfh ... okay automatic security updates ... limited user ... second computer ssh ... oh, whoops, I never actually got the dotfiles thing quite done ... they're backed up, but the automatic process doesn't work ... okay, WELL! One server. Oh ... except the ssh allowed only has one public key, that's what scp does, lol. Okaaay ... bash profile ...</p>\n<p>Oh, man, going all day on this trying to get the nginx config set up. Didn't I have a resource that I listed here somewhere? Huh, nope, just what the Linode support people sent me. Weird.</p>\n<p>Well, this isn't going to be as difficult as defeating systemic racism, surely, and I'm barely keeping it together here, so I'm signing off for today.</p>\n<p>What the fuck,\n~g</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
