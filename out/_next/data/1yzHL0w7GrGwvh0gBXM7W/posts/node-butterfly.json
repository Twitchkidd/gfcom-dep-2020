And now, like he said, we've built the last controller method, and this little caterpillar has turned into a properly syntax-highlighted butterfly and will take to the wind!</p>\n<p>Boyoo, did I not want to get up early today or exercise, though. Did it though! Rock and roll!</p>\n<p>Lol, and like the first thing I try and do with Pug is trivial in React, but I have to be like wait no ... how? What? Okay, so I can barely think with how my dog is right now, but hopefully my fingers can do the thinking right now. You need the pug file to conditionally render forms ... oh my god, tweaker man, the neighbors, and the dog all at once, I can't. I'm giving up and throwing some YouTube on until I can calm down, lol, this is ridiculous.</p>\n<p>/// Post-script from the next day! Yeap! Didn't get any more work done yesterday! Honestly I'm going through some depression right now. I've been pretty good until now with the pandemic going on and what it's meant for me, but I have to say the past few days ... I mean yesterday it really hit, it was <em>so</em> hard to be productive in the morning.</p>\n<p>Okay, feels good to have said it, even to the ether, and I'm going to get up and do my best now!</p>\n<p>Best wishes!\n~g</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
