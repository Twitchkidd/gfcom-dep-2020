For context, we're a week into protests over George Flyod's murder. I was to upset to be able to work at all yesterday, and today I wasn't sure I was going to get there, but I took Dawa for a bike ride somewhere new, hopefully he's happy, we've both got some exercise whether my Achilles liked it or not, and ... well, I really am not supre-inspired to work on serious things right now. To quote Marshall Bock on Design Details this week,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Oh, yea, no, I don't give a shit about pixels right now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, I might be able to keep myself working if I change gears a little and do something for someone else, so I'm going to make a game for my niece. She's five, and I read that memory games were good for that age, since pre-literate kids rely more heavily on memory, so we're going to make a Match Up/Pairs game with Penny the Purple Penguin, and I'm going to forbid myself from going on social media for the rest of the day, because I'd really like to sleep tonight. I feel bad for not doing more, but I can't donate anything right now, I'm not going to leave my dog here and go protest in New London, and like, yea, I know, if I'm anxious and scared and mad all at the same time, imagine how Black people in this country feel right now. Resistance isn't a one-lane highway though, we need people protesting, donating, using their voice, and we need some people to hang in and not give up hope. If that's your lane, hang in.</p>\n<p>Now, making a game ... I wrote out some ideas on a big piece of paper and I've got tofubeats - POSITIVE going in the background, so let's do this!</p>\n<p>Ohhh, finding images for all these animals isn't going to be a thing, lol. Okay, I'm going to make it with just placeholders, and then when the rest of it is in place, I'll be more likely to do the illustration, as seeing the end result get better immediately will motivate me. Illustration can be fun, but I'm not necessarily super comfy with it, lol.</p>\n<p>Wtf, now VSCode isn't opening folders? Aaand quit and reopen worked. Wtf.</p>\n<p>Oh, also, so this had a place to live, the React core team made a statement against Facebook's actions! Vjeux turned out to be a racist though! Crazy! Not using Recoil, lol. Wtf. I almost don't want to use React, definitely going to be trying other things out, but I need a quick coding win so I can get back to it here. /// To the future!</p>\n<p>Best wishes!\n~g</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
