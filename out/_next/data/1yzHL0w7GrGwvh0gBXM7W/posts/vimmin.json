{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"Vimmin","date":"2020-06-30T14:20:09.100Z","slug":"vimmin","content":"<p>Goooood afternoon! Sorry no blog posts for a while, I've been rockin' and rollin' though! <code>master-blaster</code> is almost ready for a release! I think I need one or two more early sessions with full attention and a prolonged attension span, which has been <strong>really</strong> hard to nail down lately. After the move, my back went all crazy, and I've been staying active so that <em>I</em> don't go all crazy, rough balance though.</p>\n<p>Basically though, I need to get this thing to a point where <em>I</em> can use it, and at least create a log file for wtf it's doing if someone else decides to use it and needs to know, and then I need to share it and try to get someone(s) who know what they're doing to help make it more broadly applicable, update my resume, and then split my time again between cover letter writing and applications and whatever the next project is :) It might be Polar Pairs again, because Shelly is coming through with some artwork!</p>\n<p>I'm going to assume no more updates for the day though, my sleep schedule is all out of whack, I got up crazy early today and started working, but it's already whatever o'clock and I'm losing it. Lot I'm working on right now, lol.</p>\n<p>Best wishes!\n~g</p>\n<p>P.S. Remembered how to exit Vim without looking it up! That was the title. That's it.</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
