Orr-taah-gooh-gnhngl, is about as good as I can do in terms of pidgeon phonetics. He was a stitch, always walked in in a rush, either that or looking just very tired and with a look on his face like don't talk to me, lol. We loved him because he'd swear at us, and we thought it was hilarious. Once called me \"extremely anal\" over notation, which I'm somewhat proud of. Saw him years later, and poured his latte with great care, made a little flower on top with the foam, it was great :)</p>\n<p>ANYWAY, I think the dog is good for a bit, we got a walk in and it's too early to go to Harkness, though lord have mercy I don't know if I can hook the trailer up today. We're having success with running on grass and his little pawpads growing thicker again, though! Yesterday I was going to have a doctor's appointment, but I lost the paperwork and was feeling super-anxious about it and asked them to send me the paperwork again and postpone the appointment, so looking at the 30th for that, but so I decided we needed to break out from the routine a little, and we biked to Oswegatchie and ran that trail, and got rained on, and it was just about at the limit of what I could do at that moment, leg-wise.</p>\n<p>Coding time though, I should fix the git new bug for sure, and maybe tackle the logger function.</p>\n<p>Oh, this git new thing is driving me nuts, looking at ~/.gitconfig is next though, what's alias new actually being stored as that it's not coming up as a git command? AHHH Popen adds quotes automatically! Okay, no quotes!</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
