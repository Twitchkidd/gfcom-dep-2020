Batched a bunch of phone calls this morning, and it absolutely sapped my mental energy for the day. Communicating with a very small number of other people about something we are enthusiastic about boosts my energy, communicating with a large number, (lol, nine,) about things none of us are enthusiastic about ... nothing quite like it to suck the life force out of me.</p>\n<p>Handled that, treated the dog well, ate healthy food and kept the kitchen clean, and I <strong>cannot wait</strong> for tomorrow morning when I know where I stand, financially and in terms of responsibilities, and can dig back in and rock and roll.</p>\n<p>On a positive note, I thought to myself today, <em>imagine</em> if I'd tried to actually get a serious job as a dev a year ago? I've gotten <em>so</em> much better, and if I can push through, even though we're kinda on the edge right now, Dawa and I, my little fam, it's looking like 2020 is going to be the year of getting our **** together. There's a lot to be excited about, but I'm totally tapped for to ... day ... as the upstairs neighbor burns something and sets the smoke alarm off, lol. Hoping the apartment people have another unit I can move to, even though I <em>just</em> got Internet set up. I can deal with loud music or crying babies, but the tweaker guy barking curses as he goes by my apartment every day is going to throw me over the edge.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow though, a little better.</p>\n<p>Best wishes, ~g</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
