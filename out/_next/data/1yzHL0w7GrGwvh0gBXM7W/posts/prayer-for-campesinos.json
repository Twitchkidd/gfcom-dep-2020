The coffee is amazing this morning, thanks to my sister, and thanks to the camesinos! Diving right in!</p>\n<p>Rocking and rolling! Geospatial API endpoints, plotting places on a custom Google map, pushing user data to the API, displaying pages based on that user data ... pretty exciting stuff! Maybe a little over-caffeinated here, which is having the effect of putting me to sleep, so I think it's stir-fry time!</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Wow, okay, so stir-fry went great, <em>second tech interview</em> also went great! Solid maybe on this one! Definitely still getting used to video call interviews ... like, would definitely rather meet inperson, it's just so much easier with social cues, I have a hard enough time as it is, but while I was nervous, I knew what to <em>do</em> with the nervousness a little better ... Alright, well tomorrow I have to hit the ground running again, I think I'm done-zow for today. Polish off advanced relationship population, advanced aggregation, and implementing pagination, then the deployment episodes, and I'm glad the series hits on Heroku a bit, that's what this place I interviewed at was using ... along with Python, PostGres ... did I hear Django, or was I hallucinating? Definitely React Native, and Stripe, and Twillio, so that's no worries, and it doesn't sound like they were going to pay as much as like the last place I interviewed at, but getting paid was definitely on the table.</p>\n<p>Holy crap, the bass is <em>bumping</em> upstairs! They've been going since like 5, it's like 7, and I'm just going to whistle along ... what else can I do? I mean, it's a Tuesday, who can blame them? Who would waste a Tuesday? We only live so long.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,\n~g</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
