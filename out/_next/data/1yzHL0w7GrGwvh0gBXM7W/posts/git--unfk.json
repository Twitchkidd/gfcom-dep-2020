Apparently <em>some</em> of the subprocess commands on the machine I was testing on ran, including changing the branch, so when I went to save changes, I git push git pulled without looking at the branch name ... wah wah. I needed to slow down, anyway, like maybe I can finish today, but yesterday wasn't the day. I got the first complete (if not correct, lol) set of operations down, except for cleaning up the temp ... actually I just realized the creation of the temporary branches is wrong, too, there's a good chance there <em>will</em> be a folder already at the local directory they supplied or ~/ named whatever the repo owner's username is ...</p>\n<p>Okay, well, lots to do, the end is in sight, let's ... test!</p>\n<p>/// Ahh, I haven't been logging because I've been just cramming in as much coding and self- and dog-care as possible, I really think tomorrow will be the day! Figured out subprocess stuff! I just don't want to run the code before I've read it again first thing in the morning. Good night! Best wishes! ~g</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
