Then when I run out of energy later I've got some hardware stuff to do! Yay!</p>\n<p>New machine is great, btw, though I'm having a hard time using the right-click function on the trackpad, and it's running a little hot. No WONDER, though, how did they get a whole computer in here?! It's TINY!</p>\n<p>Ok go go go!</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Ahhhh, I'm not used to python environment stuff yet! I ran pipenv install -e . and pipenv shell, and <em>then</em> I was able to run master-blaster ... eep though.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Hey, this is going pretty smoothly now! Yay for libraries! Yay for <a href=\"https://github.com/tmbo/questionary\">questionary!</a></p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
