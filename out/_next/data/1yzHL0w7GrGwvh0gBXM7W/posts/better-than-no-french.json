I'm actually just getting around to writing after a few rounds, I've got a little tech demo set up, I've had a run and two coffees, Dawa will probably need a walk soon here, so let me see if I can blast through this, I really want to try this react-wordcloud library out, and feed it my blog posts here, lol. Could be good.</p>\n<p>I've got like eighty things open right now, not really eighty, but it feels like it, because like I'll go down a rabbit hole and I'll do as good a job being thorough on the way back ... okay, no dig! Lol! Finish the ten little projects you set yourself up for, go!</p>\n<p>/// Whoa ... okay, so, I can't look at code anymore. I so don't really <em>need</em> to do this word-cloud thing, but I should really get more familiar with this kind of map-reduce thing. Right now, the next step when my head is on straight again is to make sure I have it very clear where the asynchronous calls are being made. Got a functioning reducer for one file, just need to map over the files now. Got the files, too. Woot. Good night!</p>\n<p>And best wishes!\n~g</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
