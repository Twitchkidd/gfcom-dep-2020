We're shipping.</p>\n<p>The problems right now are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the collaborator/organization stuff isn't working, might just comment it out,</li>\n<li>I'm having doubts as to whether having the option to only do public repos is a good design decision,</li>\n<li>the default branch not updating, the script worked, so it's the loop that need updating,</li>\n<li>I'm not getting error messages back, but testing and shoring it up beyond the most basic use case has to be v2,</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Oh, my God, I'm an idiot! someProcess.stdout.read() is like a file read and once it's read, the cursor is at the end! I was going like if len(stdout.read()) > 0: and then trying to do something with stdout.read(), but I have to capture it and <em>then</em> ... eugh, omg lol.</p>\n<p>/// Much later. Very tired. Not getting released tonight, up early again tomorrow. Ahh. Best wishes, ~g.</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
