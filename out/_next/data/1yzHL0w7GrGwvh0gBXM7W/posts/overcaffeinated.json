I <em>was</em> mentioned in episode 348: Getting Unstuck of the Design Details podcast (!) and was <strong>wildly</strong> misquoted in New London's newspaper The Day:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I don't like running or biking; this is my thing, I like juggling,\" he said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At least this photo was okay:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/overhead.jpg\" alt=\"Gareth juggles three balls in overhead style\"></p>\n<p>///</p>\n<p>Alrighty, so it's evening, I've relaxed somewhat, still going to be a stressfull week, mais c'est la vie, let's check <strong>this</strong> out though! <code>gatsby-remark-vscode</code> is a plugin that ... well, <em>should</em> soak up my vscode theme so that code looks like ...</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">import { css } from 'styled-components';\n\nconst size = {\n    small: 400,\n    med: 960,\n    large: 1140,\n};\n\nexport const above = Object.keys(size).reduce((acc, label) => {\n    acc[label] = (...args) => css`\n        @media (min-width: ${size[label] / 16}em) {\n            ${css(...args)}\n        }\n    `;\n    return acc;\n}, {});\n\nexport const below = Object.keys(size).reduce((acc, label) => {\n    acc[label] = (...args) => css`\n        @media (max-width: ${size[label] / 16}em) {\n            ${css(...args)}\n        }\n    `;\n    return acc;\n}, {});\n</code></pre>\n<p>OH, SWEET, DUDE!
