So close to getting <code>master-blaster</code> done (enough for me to use it myself) and then I'm going to call out to social media for anyone who wants to help guide improving it, and work on the things I've totally been neglecting. Ahhh. You can say it's a very, very small program and sure, that, \"We didn't ask for the branch to be changed from master to main, we wanted police to stop killing us. How's that going?\" ... I'm not GitHub, though. If I was GitHub, it would'a <em>been</em> changed, and the default page too, and I'd already have stopped working with ICE ... I'm not Microsoft though, I'm just some guy, and I think words do have a certain power. I could have been looking for a job though, I hope some talented Black devs got some spots while this was ... lol, while this <em>is</em> going down, still going ...</p>\n<p>Up, though! Must post this program up! I've only got to finish the set of if statements about which repos to do what to and which to raise exceptions for, write the set of commands to change things, do the git alias thing, have it log what it does at least so some poor soul out there who doesn't read the documentation can at least see what they've done, write the documentation, and change how it's run, which I think will be easy-peasy ... let me try that now ...</p>\n<p>// a) not easy-peasy, context switchy-witchy. Finish the code. b) Dropped my phone in a marsh and had to bike my dog back and go back out for it!</p>\n<p>Okay, back at it! /// (And apparently just knocked out at some point!) Best wishes! ~g</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
