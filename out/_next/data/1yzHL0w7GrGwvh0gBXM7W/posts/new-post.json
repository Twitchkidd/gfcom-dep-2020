The morning was spent on the script that automates making new posts, because believe it or not a few dozen times later I'm really tired of oping the editor, right clicking on blog and creating a folder, naming it, creating index.md in it, opening another blog post, copy-pasting the frontmatter over, changing the title, changing the date, changing the description ...</p>\n<p>Enough. No more.</p>\n<p><code>gg</code>, <code>np</code> and I get prompted for a title and description, the answers are validated, there's a prompt for confirmation, and then the folder gets made, the file gets made, the frontmatter gets populated, and the project and file are opened in the editor. <a href=\"https://github.com/Twitchkidd/gfcom/blob/master/utils/new-post/index.js\">Code.</a></p>\n<p>I think the backup is just about done, too, where are we? I don't think I'm going to try to really keep the other laptop at parity, I think I can trust ... hmm ... ... I almost typed something that would have had my knuckles going for a knocking on the nearest wooden object ... well for the <em>moment,</em> I'm going to trust Microsoft and Google with my data. Eep.</p>\n<p>Anyway, trained hard the past few days, dog is happy, I think ... hanging in, here. Might add a post-script, in any case however,</p>\n<p>Best wishes!\n~g</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
