{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"Master Blaster","date":"2020-06-20T12:25:24.246Z","slug":"master-blaster","content":"<p>Good ... afternoon, at this point! Today I'm writing a script to rename all the primary branches of your code repositories, as 'master' as in 'master/slave' (no, (really)[https://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2019-May/msg00066.html]) is obviously problematic. I'm calling it master-blaster, and I'm going to give it a shot in Python, and might try Node afterwards if a) I can't get it to work or b) I want to make multiple versions of it!</p>\n<p>And I picked the GNU license, which disallows creating closed versions of the program. Not that it would stop racists, they don't have any damn decency to begin with, but it's something.</p>\n<p>Next up is testing the testpypi distribution, making a build alias, making it <em>do</em> something, lol, then to pypi! Let's lock that name in!</p>\n<p>Ummm and long_description, all that jazz :) (Oh, that's ... that's the whole readme ... got it ... moving these comments over here, lol ...)</p>\n<p>And gitignore dist!</p>\n<p>/// Ohoookay then! Got a lot done, I'm going to quote SRockwell's law, and I'm going to quote it accurately ... tomorrow morning! What an evening!</p>\n<p>Best wishes!\n~g!</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
