Really struggling with the back thing today! It's been more than a week since I've had a day where I didn't record a Strava activity, and I thought today I'd get a break, but Dawa was whining, and so we went back out and after I let him sniff around for a while I took him on a mile and a half run, and then we hung out at the park with another couple dogs for a bit, ... he's just started panting heavily in the corner. I'm going a little nuts here. He's already eaten and there's clean water in his bowl. And been brushed. We need a new squeaky toy, the current ones are too low on flavor. Active noise cancellation headphones time. though.</p>\n<p>Oh yay, let's make a React Native template, because I'm not using Typescript, and let me just see ... yea, ReactNativeTemplate time, something simple just to get things moving here, brain-wise.</p>\n<p>// Sweet, I've got a template set up for React Native the way I like to do it, more or less. Well, less, the refactor to styled-components isn't complete because I'm still not sure how like <code>flex: 2</code> happens in styled-components, and I'm not sure what's possible to do about bundling a styled-component back to React Native styles for the imageStyles prop, for instance, but it's got react-navigation ready to go, though I really want to review what I saw that guy in Discord doing with his stacks and context.</p>\n<p>Oh wow, can't sit, back, ow. Wow.</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
