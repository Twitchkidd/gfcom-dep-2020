I've been working very hard, and maybe writing would have given me an extra boost, through the process, but it didn't happen. Physically/mentally pretty tapped. Super-stoked, too! Just super-stoked for what I'm going to be able to do after a good night's sleep.</p>\n<p>Here's one thing though, GitHub is deprecating password-generated access tokens, which I get, but whoops! <code>master-blaster</code>'s v1 is going to ask devs to go off and generate their own token from github.com, and might later get a web-app version. Hope I can bust that out tomorrow! Totally worked, though, lol. Dawa is happy, I think, my health is ... well, you know, as taken care of as is possible right now ... more later!</p>\n<p>Best wishes!\n~g</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
