Dawa had a nice walk this morning though, we went to the park, there were some other dogs and nice people and we got some running around in. I'm looking forward to the next cup of coffee, I think I'm going to open the bag of Ethiopian. Coding time, though. I think I'll just comment out the parts of the website I'm not working on so I don't get distracted.</p>\n<p>Hmm, database stuff ... I think I thought of the least efficient way to build a query ever ... I'm going to put myself together, take Dawa out for another walk, and try again. // Ahhh, I always get the right idea when I get up from the desk and do something else lolll</p>\n<p>Oh I'm so glad I took another little break right then, they just started mowing the grass outside, I'm so on edge I think if I were trying to concentrate I'd have had a conniption, lol</p>\n<p>Hmm. Footgunned myself. I did a project-wide find and replace of User to Runner and user to runner ... think I broke it ... git reset --hard HEAD it is, lol ...</p>\n<p>Okay, well ... I don't think I understand why you'd save like, in the example app, the store 'author' is <code>{ type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId, ref: \"User\" }</code> and I was doing that with friends lists, and using the _id as a string was much simpler ... I'm sure there's a reason, but I don't know what it could be ... I should take a seperate course on MongoDB/Mongoose mastery, lol.</p>\n<p>Phew, okay, got the whole friends list thing going. Rock and roll.</p>\n<p>Best wishes!\n~g</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
