Up at six, and after our first walk I brought Dawa to Harkness State Park where we get runs in and his little paws don't have to be on concrete or asphault, and I can see improvement in the surface of his footpads! I've been keeping his runs on the sidewalk/road extremely limited and mostly running at Harkness for weeks now, after I noticed his footpads were really worn down and smooth, and very nearly blistered, though we avoided actual blistering thank goodness.</p>\n<p>Got a fair amount done after he was good and exercised, I took my laptop to Fort Trumbull and whipped up a few very small sample projects for HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Python, as I'm hoping to bring someone through why and how to use <code>master-blaster</code>! V. excite!</p>\n<p>Anyway, so then a salad happened for lunch and I ran nine miles barefoot, got groceries, took Dawa to the dog park and worked from there for a while, cooked for him, and now I've saved/uploaded what I was working on and am enjoying this beautiful evening on my patio here, with a beverage and snacks!</p>\n<p>How long does my back permit me so sit, is really the question behind whether I get any further work done this evening, lol.</p>\n<p>Thinking it's going to be an extra-early day tomorrow, honestly I'm pretty worked for now. Pleasant evening out, though, my neighbor Ron the chef just walked by and said hello with his family, there's a squirrel chillen out front, birds chirping, do like.</p>\n<p>Best wishes!\n~g</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
