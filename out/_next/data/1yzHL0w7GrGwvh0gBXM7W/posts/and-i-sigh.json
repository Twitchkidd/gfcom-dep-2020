Sorry for the melodramatic title/description, song lyric :) Check out the enume track Salami Rose - Instrumental ... not sure where the vocals were sampled from, amazing tones though. Anyway! Up at 4! Let's do this!</p>\n<p>// Okay, well I can do like an hour of standing desk before back pain makes me stop, wah-wah, lol. Dawa is just chillen on the patio, wonder if he wants to go for a walk yet ...</p>\n<p>/// So, this is a P.S., I worked my butt off and released <code>master-blaster</code> that Saturday. Took Sunday totally off, recapping and diving back in with a post on Monday! BW, ~g</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
