Woke up today totally blah, because I went into the comments section on a Reddit post last night (big mistake, lol) and didn't get a lot of sleep, and then my daylight bulb went on <em>just</em> as I was starting to dream, but it turns out the very last type of whole bean coffee at Stop and Shop, which I'd previously avoided because it's marketed as \"Patriot's Blend\" and I thought would be a dark roast for sure, is actually a light roast and while not exceptional, is a tasty brew! Light on the tongue, not a whole lot up front, but a distinct nutty wash ... which rather brings it around to the Reddit post ... but let's get the party started here.</p>\n<p>I also realized that I <em>love</em> this, again, today. I can't <em>wait</em> to get coding in the morning, and it's been what I've been doing every morning since I got my mornings back.</p>\n<p>Okay, so, get to parity with the tutorial project: create the register get and post routes, create the register page template, create the user and auth controllers, create the user model, register the user model with mongoose, check that it's working, go!</p>\n<p>Btw, I've been listening to <strong>tofubeats</strong> rather than lo-fi, and I <em>dig it!</em></p>\n<p>Oh, and set up the passport handler and require that in app.js, right!</p>\n<p>Sahweet! Typed like mad for an hour and only wrote in four bugs! Got user registration! I love the part where you're cementing knowledge, way less work than the first part, lol.</p>\n<p>// Brr, brisk out! Got 4.5mi in though. I could've done a workout here, but I'm just spending so much time in the apartment these days ... listened to Dr. Jane Goodall being interviewed though! Holey moly! What a jump cable of grounding and hope! If you're looking for it, and do, it's The Tim Ferriss Show, which I don't often listen to, but he gets the most amazing guests on sometimes!</p>\n<p>Okay, back to it, back to ... Virtual Field, login/logout middleware, and protected routes!</p>\n<p>Awesome, got all the way through user account screen and password reset flow, next up is sending email from node! But I'm at the point where the next step is getting my other project to parity, and I should probably apply to some jobs. I've got Oluwatobitowa on the line though, hopefully he's working on init-ing his git repository. Sometimes I respond to him and I'm not sure he's got it ... OH there he is, yay! AWW his power is out again! WTF!</p>\n<p>// Lol, so I just poured my heart out into the various questions for the Automattic application ... then saw that a cover letter was required ... so I drafted up a .txt saying to please read the answers to the questions in more-or-less letter format ... I don't think I'll get that one, lol. Maybe, I did kinda go on about stuff I do that's very much aligned with their values. I've gone through the 'A's though, so I'm going to arm myself with a cover letter, possibly commit a few hours to tidying up my portfolio site, and then take another stab at the list. Also, do not do important things when you are tired or hungry ... <strong>when will I learn!!!</strong></p>\n<p>Alright, so I'm winding down, but I should just mention that listening to that podcast totally saved my day, also the TrailRunner Nation with Simon Marshall and Lesley Paterson on how the brain works, and also Books I've Loved with Matt Mullenweg, whose company I applied to today, lol. I want to keep the routine going through tomorrow morning at least, since I'm at such a perfect point here, but I'm definitely primed for some big changes, I feel. For now, over and out.</p>\n<p>And best wishes!\n~g</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
