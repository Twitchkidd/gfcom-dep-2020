{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"Application Partay","date":"2020-04-15T12:20:07.128Z","slug":"application","content":"<p>Gooood ... afternoon? Afternoon. It's been a day, so far, but I need to jump right in, here. I got a Google Maps key to work with, went through the last video in the Geolocation section in the Learn Node series, and I looked at a few examples of how people used CRA and Express together, I think what I'm going to do though, to cement my knowledge, get something functional up, and get used to refactoring, and not have to galaxy-brain today because for whatever reason I'm just not filled with energy and creativity today, is to start up another branch of run-club-web where I basically remake it how Wes has Dang That's Delicious set up at this point in the series, and then refactor it after that. Ready, set, go!</p>\n<p>Oh, you know what, I'm just going to rename it dep-run-club-web and make the git repo private, now I know how to use dotenv.</p>\n<p>// Oof, hours later! I think I've got everything in <em>relatively</em> minimalistically, just need to put the fonts in and get some icons going. And yes, I read the webpack config! Which I might not otherwise have, lol. Oh boy.</p>\n<p>Okay, so <em>now</em> it's a job application party, or as my mother would've said, a partay. :) Made sure I got supplies, got some soup in, walked Dawa, fed Dawa, got some music going, drinks, snacks, aaand apply to jobs time! Aaand my Internet cuts out, nice :) ... It came back :)</p>\n<p>// Well, I only tied the number of applications I put out yesterday, but several were from the 'tier 1' list today, and I spent extra time on them! Got back from the after chow-time walk with Dawa and our across-the-way neighbor was in handcuffs! Wonder what we missed.</p>\n<p>I have a good point to pick up again tomorrow, going to sign out for now and call it a night, stoked for an early day tomorrow though! Dawa and I had a day off from our runs, which have been getting longer, and I've been going for long enough here I know what a good next route will be!</p>\n<p>Best wishes!\n~G</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
