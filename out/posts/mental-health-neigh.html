Also my sister sent me pictures of her husband and their kids on ... well, battery powered unicorns and horses? With the sticks, you know what I'm talking about, you hop about as if you're riding horses, it's a good time. <strong>HENCE,</strong> it's a mental health neigh. :)</p>
<p>I was pretty seriously depressed this morning. Most of the time, at least in recent memory, I've been more-or-less able to keep it together. This morning started off not great though. So I thought of the things I wanted to get done, and then I decided to get the things done that really mattered, and that meant getting up, making a nice cup of coffee on the French press, getting the couple of dishes done, walking Dawa, eating a breakfast salad, writing a letter to my niece, getting a workout in (day three of #coronalMassEjection!) and giving Dawa an anti-anxiety pill, which meant after the workout I was able to put myself together, have some granola and soy milk, and spend the next like three hours cutting Dawa's hair and trying to get his nails done. It is a <em>process.</em> Like, it's a haircut where you've got to stop and get some lunch and another coffee in the middle. Lunch was beans and rice, and the coffee was eighty grams a grande on the French press by the Hoffman technique, but ground for French press rather than metal, because I didn't want to bother with another round of decanting the silt out this time.</p>
<p>Sooo, I find myself unable to bring myself to finish the last ten percent of Dawa's haircut (much like the last ten percent of the coding project I should be working on, says a part of my brain,) and with excellent nutrition and a lot of caffeine in me, and I decide to find a trail. I'd been mulling it over, but I was talking with the nice lady with the two little dogs, Lola and Pepper, down at the dog park, and getting just a little bit of socialization (from a distance!) in, and asking about the bridge to Groton, where I'd seen on a map that there were some trails within a reasonable distance, and she said there was a pedestrian-slash-bike path, well that did it, it's Sunday, I'd find the trail and next weekend, if I'd done well this coming week, I'd have something to look forward to doing, so I packed some water, glanced at the map for general directions, and headed out.</p>
<p>Skip ahead to the nice officer informing me, halfway across, that you can't just bike across the bridge (I95,) and me responding yes, thank you, this doesn't look anything like the bike path, him asking me whether I was from New London, me saying I'd just moved here and had heard that there was, him rolling his eyes and proceeding to explain in depth how there was a pedestrian-slash-bike path on the north side of the bridge, though notably without good directions to or instructions on how to find the entrances to this path beyond 'ask someone,' but there we have it, and he was nice enough to escort me across the rest of the bridge with his lights on, rolling along in the shoulder behind me at a good twenty, twenty-five miles an hour, and I waved as I exited and chalked it up to another biking on a bridge adventure, and ask me about the others in person and not in writing if you don't mind, but so eventually I got to Groton.</p>
<p>And oohhh, Nelly are there some nice trails a couple miles in, there!! It's not like, expansive, as far as trail networks go, but that's <em>the stuff!</em> Single-track, rocks, roots, roller-coaster little hills, brooks to jump over, occasional mountain bikers to overtake, and some real <em>nature!</em> I just don't feel myself when I can't feel like a ... oh, that word has some negative connotations ... savage is only sort of what I mean, and invoking 'like an animal' doesn't really improve matters ... it's so important to me, but I lack the vocabulary to talk about it in a way that invokes the feeling of really being a part of the natural world around oneself in a non-problematic way, and to at once say that it's indicative <em>of</em> a problem in society today, <em>and</em> to segue with something possibly equally problematic, forty-five minutes later found me screaming like a little girl.</p>
<p>I'd forgotten that I was afraid of heights, and, when I finally used Google Maps to navigate me to the pedestrian-slash-bike path (which was <em>hardly</em> marked at all, and also Google took me down absolutely-not-a-bike-path to get there at one point!) I found myself on a pathway that varied from three to sometimes two feet wide with a several hundred foot drop on the side that wasn't Jersey barrier, and the seperation between you and that was a series of thin vertical iron bars, with nothing horizontal happening anywhere between the very bottom and ten feet up. Think of the last time you went by some barrier that consisted of just vertical slits, and how they tend to just visually disappear. Basically the experience was of careening along a narrow path, at speed, with certain death looming and drawing you in, as the abyss tends to, on one side. Whoever designed this was an @\$\$hole. I think the one gentleman also using the path correctly read my genuine terror and chuckled a bit at or with me. After clenching my handlebars and the seat with my hands and thighs, screaming, "I don't want to be here!" "Who would do such a thing! (Designing it this way)" and good ole', "AAAHHHHHAHAHAHAAAHAAAAA!!!!!" I exited, marked where the entrance was, and, swearing I'd never go back, marked the spot in my memory for the next time I'll go to the trail across the bridge in Groton.</p>
<p>Now to finish putting the chicken I've just made down for Dawa, posting this, and winding down for the night, and tomorrow I've got a very important phone call, could stand to finish up the rest of Dawa's haircut, and could probably stand to enjoy some of the sixty degrees and sunshine with him, poor little guy, and we'll figure out the coding thing and the financial thing and the computer part thing (anyone own an extremely small pair of needlenose pliers?) with a head that's ready to reason things through calmly and rationally, in a more grounded manner, so to speak.</p>
<p>For now, best wishes!
