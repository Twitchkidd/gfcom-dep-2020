Double pillows and feet up on the toolbox with some jeans on it, then the stand for the second monitor with a sweatshirt over my legs and between the two so the laptop doesn't eventually fry my lap and is just a little elevated, and I think I can work and not have back pain for a bit, lol. I've got a tray next to me with a sketch pad, notes, and pen, and snacks on the non-Dawa side, and a little bit here, and let's see:</p>
<p>I'm going to change how posts are structured, so I'll have a place for everyday journaling, and then I'm going to make more like 'Blog Post' type blog posts on actual subjects, and eventually I'm going to make everything searchable and sorted nicely and all that jazz, but <strong>for the moment!:</strong></p>
<p>Oh, two things, actually, Dawa jumped over a like three foot maybe three plus foot fence today! It was awesome! He's the best!</p>
<p>Then the other thing, oh, three things, what was the first one though so I don't lose it ... was it the apartment? Yes, I think so! I've continued the clean of my apartment and within a very short time there are going to be no cardboard boxes in the middle of the floor and it's going to be amazing! And the bathroom is going to get cleaned, vacuuming is going to get done, surfaces dusted ... OOO and I switched the bulbs around, got a new extension cord and surge protector, and not the apartment is like properly lit, too!</p>
<p>The world is crumbling around us, it would seem, so taking care to enjoy the small wins is crutial :)</p>
<p>Anyway, coding! Oh, yea, and the third thing! I got <a href="trailcity.net">trailcity.net</a> up as a Node/Express app very quickly! It's still not like, there yet, and I took the server down I think, but oh my goodness, I used to not know wtf, but this time I kinda knew wtf and I was able to just <strong>do it!</strong> Crazy!!! It was <em>not</em> so long ago that touching a server was like physically painful because of the level of anxiety ...</p>
<p>I need to get organized with work stuff and get my work stuff organized (which will be easier with a place that's put together!) I've got this website, which, whooof, needs work, that's basically everything though, right?, and then trailcity.net slaaash Run Club, and then there's the backing the computer up project, and there's the getting back into React Native development, since that's pretty hot and like, just having the devices/sim/emulators going at any point in time is a biggie, lol, and theeen ... and then there's the cover letter and applying places, and theeen ... and then there's continuing to hop on Discord/Twitter and be helpful/visible, and theeen ... I dunno, there's so much to think about inside each project, and those things so often are like directly relevant in any other project, or a set of other projects, and I just want to say I was hoping to get built those sites for sharing those e-books and the penguin thing, before finishing saying it's not all about the individual projects :)</p>
<p>I wonder what sort of ToS agreement I'm going to have to write for Run Club right now? Like, "PLEASE DON'T USE THIS RIGHT NOW, LITERALLY, IT'S PROBABLY AGAINST THE LAW. DO NOT GATHER IN GROUPS IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. Just in case you want to beta-test it, or have a social/legal circumstance for this, here it is, though!"</p>
<p>Okay, <strong>positives!</strong> Sure, the economy is tanking right now, but guess who's going to have to have an online presence now for sure? Everyone! Hate to look for a silver lining amongst <em>sooo much death,</em> lol.</p>
<p>I don't know where I'm going to pull the energy from for the next stage of this cleaning process though. Or the next stage of the coding process, like ... okay, in real life, still need to do the bathroom, and I didn't get it in one go and now there are a few dishes in the sink and sooo many dishes got done, and then with gfcom like, I don't know what my deal is with not wanting to upgrade my build/deploy pipeline, but the upload times are getting longer and longer and I'm not even doing it regularly anymore. It's time, there, but like getting to that git diff and seeing like, oh, of course, I blow the ./public folder away to rebuild ... That updates, though, I should be able to just delete ./.cache if I'm just adding a post and not doing anything fancy? Okay, I know the next test to run there ... that was such a brick wall though ... and then with the Run Club project, it's just ... eh, wah, wah, wah, call the wahmbulance. Got some routes. Routes need handlers. Handlers kind of a pain because they have to get data with Mongoose, and also I started working on them immediately after the course (except for the sass adventure? Maybe others? Notes project!) and didn't have the juice to finish building everything up in one go. I can do this, though, and it's all coming together. New resumé, new (feel to the) apartment, wonderful new info coming down the line from the podcasts I listen to, which I absolutely need to make a widget/page for ... must spend more time in design app! A hundred other thoughts! 🙃</p>
<p>// So, turns out that was a recipe for a nap, lol. but I got some more dev stuff done later ... I wish I had budgeted the energy for a wrapup, just dipped my toes in the contenerization world, it's wild. Anyway,</p>
<p>Best wishes!
