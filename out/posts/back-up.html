<p>First thing, changed the title from Gareth Field, Dot Com! to Gareth Field ...

I have no idea if I'm good enough, I've been doing this for six years now, but I've been working and handling life at the same time, but I need to get myself out there (digitally, lol, still under quarantine) and see what happens!

<p>Let's go!</p>
<p>... Let's also test block quotes!</p>

<p>Hmm, interesting, so <code>smartypants</code> works, though it turns the @ symbol into something obnoxious, and it ignored new lines. Does the pre tag work here?</p>
<pre>
Words
on
multiple
lines ...
</pre>
<p>Mmm, yea, but how to combine? That's not a now problem, that's a later problem.</p>

<p>Oh, now we have a font problem ... and smartypants didn't get the em-dash, either. Le sigh.</p>
<p>Layout time. Main objectives: alter 'bio' for landing page, set up the nav bar and main areas, make it work on mobile, make the footer content, and populate the main content.</p>
<p>Sweet, okay, bio adjusted, removed the title link on the landing page ... where to put this blog content? Oh, I'm going to have to store the current tab somewhere, because hitting back after going to a blog post should return you to the homepage with the coding tab selected and probably scrolled to the right place ... Ehhh, we'll get there, let's start by just omitting it and getting the area for the nav bar and main content set up on desktop, like, part one stuff here.</p>
<p>Alright, so main is just children of layout right now ... need a nav component ...</p>
<p>Lol I'm glad like every keystroke and error message aren't recorded ... as I totally forget how to author and use components for a split sec ... //</p>
<p>Okay, dog walked again, ready to tackle this nav thing. Just going to write the desktop version for the moment. Nav takes up a space, main takes up a space, main renders content based on what nav item is selected. <del>How hard could it</del> hOw HaRd CoUlD iT bE?</p>
<p>Lol, it'd be much easier without the local tweaker wandering back and forth in front of my apartment barking swearwords. But for the grace of God goes I, I suppose though.</p>
<p>Successfully extracted the BlogList into it's own component! I know I kinda asked for it by choosing gatsby-starter-blog, but I'm at the point where I can look at how data is flowing through this thing and make changes. Alright, why is my dummy nav component rendering first here, though? Mmm, okay, after header, before children, but on the landing page, bio is part of children. So nav should be part of index? Yyy ... yes. Maybe? This is where I need to use pen and paper for a sanity check ... no, I can think through this, I only need the nav component on the index page, the layout is included as part of the index page, and also the blog posts, but the blog posts are created as pages because of gatsby-node and the template file, so anything special I'd want to change about the blog posts, except for the bio which is aware of location, I'd change in the template file and possibly ... pass in ... no, it gets its own pageQuery, because its (they're) a page (pages,) and then anything special I'd want to change about the index page I change in /pages/index, which is the only place I want Nav, right? For the moment? And then how about main, because in layout, main contains children ... of ... of page, except layout ... nav is child of layout in main ... <em>other</em> children on layout in main are affected by nav ... omg shoot me, yea, pen and paper diagramming time.</p>
<p><img src="/pen-and-paper.jpg" alt="pen and paper diagramming of website stuff"></p>
<p>Sweeeeet, figured out images in blog posts, too!</p>
<p>Okay, so, section, article, or div? I remember listening to a JavaScript Jabber episode with the semantic HTML guy and he said to like never use one of those two, article or section ... section? Okay, are the elements semantically related, no, use div, got it.</p>
<p>Oh man, need state, reaching for hooks! I'm so modern, lol.</p>
<p>LOL oh no, I have no idea what I'm doing. Efffff.</p>
<p>Oh, J/K, I just needed to refresh the page. Silly me. Yay I get hooks! Sort of! We're passing functions, we're doing all that stuff, yeah! My legs are falling asleep! //</p>
<p>Definitely still sick, acutally took a nap there. I like <em>never</em> take a nap, and I know like people are dying, so big whoop, but like I'm about as healthy as someone could expect to be ... anyway, I've got a moment here, must press on. Definitely not applying for jobs today ... I always think I can get so much more done in a day! Wtf, me?!</p>
<p>Okay, so right now we've got just a div with maxWidth set, marginLeft and marginRight auto, and padding. So let's see, we want height to be 100vh and overflow hidden, and then the mainContent div will be scrollable, and somehow we've got to establish first and second key lines for horizontal rhythm, with the title, avatar, and tab icons aligned to the first key line, and the blurb and tab titles aligned to the second, with content following. And my dog wants to be fed. So at least we got that far, lol.</p>
<p>Oof, so, got some conditional rendering going with an IIFE, because I like that inline style, dog is fed, dog wants another walk, check out <a href="youtube.com/healthcaretriage">Healthcare Triage</a> for the latest on coronavirus Covid-19, stay safe out there, I'm going to call it, pretty productive day, maybe could have done a little better, what a time though.</p>
<p>Best wishes, ~g</p>

But for the grace of God goes I, I suppose though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuccessfully extracted the BlogList into it's own component! I know I kinda asked for it by choosing gatsby-starter-blog, but I'm at the point where I can look at how data is flowing through this thing and make changes. Alright, why is my dummy nav component rendering first here, though? Mmm, okay, after header, before children, but on the landing page, bio is part of children. So nav should be part of index? Yyy ... yes. Maybe? This is where I need to use pen and paper for a sanity check ... no, I can think through this, I only need the nav component on the index page, the layout is included as part of the index page, and also the blog posts, but the blog posts are created as pages because of gatsby-node and the template file, so anything special I'd want to change about the blog posts, except for the bio which is aware of location, I'd change in the template file and possibly ... pass in ... no, it gets its own pageQuery, because its (they're) a page (pages,) and then anything special I'd want to change about the index page I change in /pages/index, which is the only place I want Nav, right? For the moment? And then how about main, because in layout, main contains children ... of ... of page, except layout ... nav is child of layout in main ... \u003cem\u003eother\u003c/em\u003e children on layout in main are affected by nav ... omg shoot me, yea, pen and paper diagramming time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/pen-and-paper.jpg\" alt=\"pen and paper diagramming of website stuff\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweeeeet, figured out images in blog posts, too!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, so, section, article, or div? I remember listening to a JavaScript Jabber episode with the semantic HTML guy and he said to like never use one of those two, article or section ... section? Okay, are the elements semantically related, no, use div, got it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh man, need state, reaching for hooks! I'm so modern, lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLOL oh no, I have no idea what I'm doing. Efffff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, J/K, I just needed to refresh the page. Silly me. Yay I get hooks! Sort of! We're passing functions, we're doing all that stuff, yeah! My legs are falling asleep! //\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDefinitely still sick, acutally took a nap there. I like \u003cem\u003enever\u003c/em\u003e take a nap, and I know like people are dying, so big whoop, but like I'm about as healthy as someone could expect to be ... anyway, I've got a moment here, must press on. Definitely not applying for jobs today ... I always think I can get so much more done in a day! Wtf, me?!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, so right now we've got just a div with maxWidth set, marginLeft and marginRight auto, and padding. So let's see, we want height to be 100vh and overflow hidden, and then the mainContent div will be scrollable, and somehow we've got to establish first and second key lines for horizontal rhythm, with the title, avatar, and tab icons aligned to the first key line, and the blurb and tab titles aligned to the second, with content following. And my dog wants to be fed. So at least we got that far, lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOof, so, got some conditional rendering going with an IIFE, because I like that inline style, dog is fed, dog wants another walk, check out \u003ca href=\"youtube.com/healthcaretriage\"\u003eHealthcare Triage\u003c/a\u003e for the latest on coronavirus Covid-19, stay safe out there, I'm going to call it, pretty productive day, maybe could have done a little better, what a time though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBest wishes, ~g\u003c/p\u003e\n"}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"back-up"},"buildId":"1yzHL0w7GrGwvh0gBXM7W","nextExport":false,"isFallback":false,"gsp":true}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-9297741ddbbb81bca141.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/main-7fafde1b574390a64140.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-ccf5ab034a524403276a.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework.ea5d6f7a7099b14097ba.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/commons.8747e23c27b0dd437666.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/6335da8543c52d3af527c387f688061357787349.6663af1e7efa534cafac.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-c753c2b4172842b1d02e.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/posts/%5Bslug%5D-ec36b7d33a91e2c5bc74.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/1yzHL0w7GrGwvh0gBXM7W/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/1yzHL0w7GrGwvh0gBXM7W/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
