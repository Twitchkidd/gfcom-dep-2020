I'm going to be able to see today! Very exciting! And Dawa is rolled over on the floor still panting after a bike ride to Harkness and back with a 2 mile run in there (hot, even at 8am, have to shoot for earlier!) and I've got another coffee and the package with <strong>my glasses!</strong></p>
<p>For like two weeks, I haven't been able to see, and no blue light protection, so I'm waking up with my eyes red like I'm stoned or something, also, <em>ouch,</em> and I really don't need more pain right now. Managing back pain has like, partially taken over my life right now, lol. But new glasses! Not going to trust the outside pocket for anything that could potentially bounce out again, lol, went downtown and they were gone, even went back over the route twice ... eff! They were such nice glasses, too. The <em>first</em> pair I had, and that was a great story, good times, anyway, they made me feel like ... I'm having a hard time describing it ... like I'd embraced my feminine side, to a degree, but these made me feel like I could be who I was and feel not just appropriately androgenous or whatever, but really <em>good</em> looking ... I know it's crazyily vain, but with that little modification to my face I was able to bring waaay closer to one hundred percent at work and in public. That was right when people at work not only had been appreciating how hard I worked to make things nice and to look out for them and everyone in that place on both sides of the line, but they heard my story and told me that I was accepted, that I belonged there. That brought a lot of closure on the previous ... when was that? Obama was president. I don't ... know ... oh, so Google Photos says in late 2015 I was at Merrell, so this must have been like October 2016. So, eleven years.</p>
<p>Big shoes, new glasses, big shoes. I got them <em>online</em> too ... so much cheaper! Let's see, let's see!</p>
<p>Haha, well, let me try again with the look thing when I've cut my hair and lost a few pounds, but I can <strong>see!</strong> Nice!</p>
<p>Can't code though, Dawa wants to go out again. Had a feeling we might need one more walk here, he hadn't pooped on our first walk. C'est la vie avec chien.</p>
<p>// Okay, pooped! Coding mode GO!</p>
<p>Yay! Took all the todos for a V1 of this program and added them to a "V1" GitHub project! That took a while, though, you've got to add the issue, then go to new cards in the project, then go back to the issue, and <em>then</em> there's the option to pick a column for it. Or you can add card and then convert to issue, but that irks me, I want to be able to raise issues where I've always raised issues, it's labeled 'Issues', it's where if you've got issues, gate's open, come on in. Got issues? Don't we all! <a href="https://github.com/Twitchkidd/gfcom/issues">https://github.com/Twitchkidd/gfcom/issues</a>, bring 'em on. Nice kanban board on GitHub projects though, <a href="https://github.com/Twitchkidd/master-blaster/projects/v1">https://github.com/Twitchkidd/master-blaster/projects/v1</a>. I started using that template on the Polar Pairs project, and I think it really helped make sure I got to everything and worked on one thing at a time.</p>
<p>First up, issue #7 I classified as a bug that there was no log file. Yea. About to be messing with a bunch of repos at once, I want a record of what I've done, lol.</p>
<p>// Oh, again I'm finding the stuff baked right into Python is just sooo nice. Standing desk time, 11:30! And I've got a soup that'll cure what ails you, holy moley!</p>
<p>Yay, card for #7 needs to be revisited, the logging is happening though!</p>
<p>#4, custom loopy-doos! Most of the questions are in a flat list, I've got the more custom thing going on for some inputs, but not all, HENCE!</p>
<p>My back is <em>killing</em> me right now, lol standing here and coding is a no-go right now.</p>
<p>// Okay, so, it's much later, ready to go though, went for a long walk, set up a lot of pillows on the sofa, walked Dawa again, he got dinner, snacks, chewies, he's okay, let's go!</p>
