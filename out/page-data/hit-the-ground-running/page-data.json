Keeping everything clean and myself sane has definitely been a challenge, I think I’m doing pretty well though! Dawa got his bath, it wasn’t too too strenuous for him, we got a short run in, same, I got my spinach and vitamins in with my first coffee, got a little gluten-free granola with fruit and nuts and soy milk, about to make another coffee, Dawa’s chomping on a bully stick, I’m like put together by a reasonable hour this morning, got a little bit of a workout in … yea!</p>\n<p>I need to get this thing backed up, and I need to get Run Club finished and launched, lol. I keep on wanting to do other things, which I should totally do, but like I was thinking through various projects, a voice in my head said, ”… but is your box backed up?” to which my other voice responded, “… Right.”</p>\n<p>// Okay, walked Dawa <em>one more time</em> this morning, it’s like an hour later. Whwoo-boy.</p>\n<p>I think I was still backing up my dotfiles. Super nice out, working outside! Got some crudites going …</p>\n<p>Whoa, todo!! I don’t have automatic https upgrades on my website! Whaaat.</p>\n<p>// Lol, so my laptop was going slow, and I’ve got two browsers and Spotify open, but still, and then I realized I’d plugged it in and had turned Folding@Home on full power … ahh! Got it! Full is 4 cores, medium is 3, light is 1, sweet. Just discovered visualization options, too! Fan’s on … hmmm … going light mode, have a tile under the front of the computer, screen all the way down etc, see if it stops …</p>\n<p>I think I’m going to try Firefox for a bit. I like Brave, but I’m always running into things not working, and I wonder if Firefox and me are ready for eachother, lol. // … after a bit, I’m not sure. I feel like more of my data is going to facebook, I keep seeing it pop up … maybe it’s what I’m doing?</p>\n<p>Alright, to the future! Best wishes!\n~g</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: inline-block;\n    min-width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: inline-block;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-highlighted {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-background-color, transparent);\n    box-shadow: inset var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-width, 4px) 0 0 0 var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-color, transparent);\n  }\n  \n</style>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hit the Ground Running!","date":"May 21, 2020","description":"In which the day presents challenges.
