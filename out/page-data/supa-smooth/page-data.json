Dawa got a bike ride, some socializing with other dogs, a short run in, and I’m good to go at 9am, yay! Yesterday we needed another walk afterwards, and I had things to do around the place, not today though! Onward!</p>\n<p>First project is the resume, which will be a snap because I spent the time breaking up what needs to change into issues, so let’s see … I bet I can be done before 9:30. Let me go ahead and double that, though, unless I’ve learned nothing about how good I am at estimating how long a task will take. 10:00, and if I’m not done by then, I’ve got to clean the bathroom. It needs doing at some point here, it’s not like horrific or anything, but I’d rather not, so how about that’ll be the consequence if I don’t. Except I’m going to do one or two things here and then clock in for an hour from whenever that is, because it’s been a couple of minutes already and a part of my brain is saying no fair, lol.</p>\n<p>Okay, so the strategy is going to be to set the timer for 15 minutes and switch to standing … 9:15, go!</p>\n<p>Oh, shoot, I need to speed up, it’s been 15 minutes already? Go go go!</p>\n<p>// Well, I got a lot done, having the right amount of pressure is a wonderful thing, guess who’s cleaning the bathroom though. 🤣</p>\n<p>Dawa and I are at the park now, it’s really nice having a backup machine dedicated to working outside and moving either around the apartment or wherever else I might be.</p>\n<p>// Alrighty! V4 of the resume! It’s got a repo now, too! And I have a PNG of it, and that’s definitely going up on the website, I’m sure it’s accessible somehow, but now it’s like … ohhh, man, if I loaded it in from GitHub, I could always have the most up-to-date version … do like, one more change then … sweet!</p>\n<p>Next up is the layout, let’s see … I think I had gotten through the markup for mobile, but wasn’t done with the markup for desktop …</p>\n<p>Sweet, got that figured out, time to switch to CSS mode! Ehh … actually, I mean I went to spin up a stylesheet.css, but that’s one of the nice things about <code class=\"language-text\">styled-components</code>, I can do the Reactifying first, and then write scoped CSS. The next thing to work on is whether I’m going to nuke this thing or not, so seeing what the latest scaffolding for <code class=\"language-text\">gatsby-starter-blog</code> is … hmm, okay so just looks like updating to the v2 versions of <code class=\"language-text\">gatsby-remark-images</code> and anything else in the build step will probably do it, though I wonder what the scaffolding looks like now anyway …</p>\n<p>Also, thanks Elsbeth! My sister caught that I hadn’t paid any attention to the months field in the resume. She suggested deleting it, I’m on the fence about it based on how nicely it ties the sections together when the consistency issues with caps, and slashes and dashes was fixed.\nOkay, markup for desktop complete, Reactify, then style.</p>\n<p>Until tomorrow, best wishes!\n~g</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: inline-block;\n    min-width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: inline-block;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-highlighted {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-background-color, transparent);\n    box-shadow: inset var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-width, 4px) 0 0 0 var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-color, transparent);\n  }\n  \n</style>","frontmatter":{"title":"Supa Smooth","date":"August 04, 2020","description":"In which Gareth goes supa."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/supa-smooth/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/oh,-hey-past-me,-thanks-for-the-note/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Oh, Hey Past-Me, Thanks For The Note"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/rock,-roll,-repeat/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Rock, Roll, Repeat"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3786390493"]}
