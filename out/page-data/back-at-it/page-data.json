Relatively refreshed, at least, the saga with tweaker-man continues and like ‚Ä¶ those were two days I didn‚Äôt get any work-work done and that‚Äôs a little stressful to think about, but I really think I needed it.</p>\n<p>Today, I‚Äôm going through what I need to get done on the back end for the Run Club project to be done enough so that the next step is the front end refactor, then I‚Äôm going to update my resume and write a cover letter, and aggregate more places to apply. Next up is handling the front end of this website, because it‚Äôs not exactly a great selling point for me as a dev, and then I‚Äôll be in front end mode when I come back to Run Club, and I‚Äôll feel better about sending out stronger applications.</p>\n<p>So, the landing page as authed/non-authed is a todo, more runner info and deleting one‚Äôs account, updating the run page with chat, the runs listing page needs data to come back sorted for a map and table, the buds list needs more info and chat, and runner pages in general, and the my runs page needs data coming in sorted for a map and table, too. Aaand go! //</p>\n<p>Alright, landing page for authed/non-authed, handled, more or less, on to getting the profile filled out. I have to make a decision on how I‚Äôm going to do this, actually, but first I have to get myself together, get a workout in, and walk Dawa again. C‚Äôest la vie avec un chiene, lol! //</p>\n<p>Eugh, the amount that I did <em>not</em> want to do that workout, lol. Got a plan though, and I‚Äôm sticking to it! Okay, made some lunch, made some coffee (first French press of the Ethiopia Sidama my sister gave me! Omg! It‚Äôs like ‚Ä¶ okay, possible NSFW here, but it‚Äôs like a tangerine ‚Ä¶ no, nevermind. It‚Äôs quite good!) ‚Ä¶ and code time! //</p>\n<p>Oh, boy, that was an adventure. Updated the info that‚Äôs on the user account, and added some super-super-super ugly logic for whether it‚Äôs the first time they‚Äôre going to the edit account (profile) page ‚Ä¶ but it works, and it‚Äôs time to walk Dawa again! üê∂ Next up is chat! Oh boy, lol. Doesn‚Äôt look too bad he said?</p>\n<p>// Yo so I‚Äôm looking through various new stuff, and if you want to go on a tripm check <a href=\"https://github.com/misterunknown/ifm\">this out!
