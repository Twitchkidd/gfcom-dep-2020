They’re a React/React Native/Node shop, and want to build a diverse, inclusive team!!! I need to hope for the best and prepare for the worst, of course, but OMG!!! My fingers are crossed!</p>\n<p>Okay, second, last night I was like, sure computer, you want to upgrade the operating system, go for it, and today I woke up to bash being deprecated, which umm … whole new world here, lol. I installed <a href=\"https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh\">oh-my-zsh</a> and pasted in my .bash_profile, and it doesn’t seem too… different, I haven’t tried to run a React Native project yet. Eep. So many plugins though! Very temped to install the Chuck Norris and Cat-speak ones.</p>\n<p>Here goes … hope it works! If I can get what I want to get done on the Logoed project before talking to this person, that would be awesooome … this <em>is</em> React Native we’re talking about though, so I’ve got time to make and eat a salad and make another coffee before it loads, lol.</p>\n<p>Sahweet! Course I was greeted with an error, and I’m not sure what I did to break it, but game on!</p>\n<p>I’m going to post this up, I’m so stoked, and there’s a shortage of good news these days, heh … WOOT though!!!</p>\n<p>// Lol, so I fixed the bug <em>right</em> before the tweaker guy went by yelling. Fml, lol.</p>\n<p>Awesome, though, Got to the Logoing screen. Which I still have to build, but I’ve built it before, this won’t be too difficult, he says, lol. Come to Connecticut, they said. It’s a little quieter, they said.</p>\n<p>Uh-oh, no ruby … save me homebrew you’re my only hope? Yay! Also, thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/8955\">everyone in the GitHub issues!</a> <code class=\"language-text\">brew install cocoapods ruby &amp;&amp; brew link --overwrite cocoapods</code> did it for me!</p>\n<p>Hmm, I broke the ProfileCreation screen … when did I do that? Whooaah, it just lagged massively … weird, lol. Whaaat and an affirmative response didn’t load the BusinessSelection screen! Wait, I should do that whole thing differently anyway, hold on … lol, though reloading the JavaScript bundle fixed all the glitches … come on :)</p>\n<p>Hmm, so this is interesting … currently, the root navigator relies on Context to render either the ProfileCreation stack, which itself only has one screen, navigates to the Modal within the root navigator for a confirmation screen, and then either sets the Context so that the Logoing stack is displayed, or doesn’t if the response from the modal isn’t affirmative, and then I was like, well this should clearly just navigate to the BusinessSelection screen on affirmative, but it’s not in the same stack … which, I should try it, might actually just work based on react-native navigate actions tending to fall back to the level above if it doesn’t find a screen with that name, but that’s a silly way of doing it if being explicit about it is just as easy.</p>\n<p>ANOTHER company reached out! WHOA!!! SOOO stressful answering the salary question though! I asked Reactiflux about it, maybe they have some words of reassurance :)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Anyone ever feel extremely uncomfortable answering the, “What do you expect your salary to be?” question? I’ve never really had an actually salaried job in tech, just a freelance gig or two, and I think I’m, like, okay, but compared to the minimum wage that I’m used to working retail (doing my best! :slight_smile: ) the amount that I feel I should be responding to this question with just feels absolutely ludicrous … Like … I basically just wrote a number down that I pulled out of my … pulled out of the back of my mind remembering the State of JavaScript survey and divided by 12, and even then I lowered it twice before actually sending the message … like … a pat on the back and a crust of bread every once and a while would probably seem like too much, and I know, I know, rent, but holy moley … is this really the world we’re living in? Like, I’ve been working at this when I can for like six years now, but it doesn’t feel real, you know? — Twitchkidd</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ooof, where was I? Ahh, there’s only so much daylight here, dog-walking time again!</p>\n<p>// Okay, this has turned into a tomorrow morning question. There’s only so much being out in the cold I can take. It’s April, definitely ready for some Spring-like temperatures. The orchid is budding, though!
