Walked Dawa, got a letter off to my neice, let’s get to it!</p>\n<p>What are we doing … we got registration down, just need to go over login/logout middleware, reset password flow, and then today we learn about sending email from Node! (The <em>most</em> exciting stuff, I know … I think I’ve spent a good quarter of my time coding on user authentication and that type of thing at this point, oh well, is what it is :) Oh, protected routes, too, and virtual fields, right.</p>\n<p>Alright, busted that out, put myself together, walked Dawa again and went through some job listings, onto the next lesson in the course!</p>\n<p>Dope, so still in dev-mode, but at least it’s sending out fake emails, figured relational data out, time to reapply to the other project … //</p>\n<p>Coded for a while, and when I come back, I must solve the mystery of photo uploads, test the tags page, and test the password reset flow! I can’t sit anymore for the moment though.</p>\n<p>Boyoo, there are a lot of companies that start with ‘Bio’ … so I went through a bunch more potential job listings, and I worked on getting my backup machine up to snuff, I’m really tired though and don’t feel like pushing more caffeine into my system, so I’m going to give myself a break for the rest of the evening. I’m going to spatchcock a chicken. Tomorrow I’m going to get a workout in, and Tuesday I’m going to get in a run to destress before the interview, is the plan.
