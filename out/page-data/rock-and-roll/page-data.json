I think if I can avoid doing anything traumatic, and just handle the tightness from the muscle wanting to protect the tendon, and do enough barefoot training and functional cross training, I might just become a runner again. More on that later. Time to code.</p>\n<p>Time to … time to connect where I got to with prop-drilling, and where my dude Yusuff is trying to get me to with context, first with class components, and then, apparently more simply, with functional components. Pen and paper time, for sure, my brain just isn’t there yet, even after the second cup of coffee … should be kicking in here.</p>\n<p>NVM! Functional first! Wtf … not going to touch the class component thing unless I need to. At first I was like oh no, hooks scary, it took very, very little time to switch though.</p>\n<p>Okay, so next up is taking a look at that tabs library again, now that createContext/useContext aren’t a total mistery. Dog walk first. Maybe grab a beer. #Random on Reactiflux had some serious racists breezing through. Handled it well, though, didn’t rise to any name-calling, and continued conversation with non-trolls. Upsetting, though. TO THE FUTURE! //</p>\n<p>So I’m looking at the source for this tabs library, and now that I’ve seen createContext/useContext used in a more concrete setting, and understand that the children as function thing … is a thing … at least it’s not Greek to me, but I don’t think I’m going to try and understand all of what’s going on there and just use it.</p>\n<p>Sweet! Got a demo with the styling/wrappers I’m using on this site going in a little test project, and you know what? That will be it for today! Helped a few people on Reactiflux, posted my resume there (ahh!) did some networking on the Twitters, listened to React Native Radio, the most recent episode with Jared Palmer on Formik, which I want to try to throw into a project because now I get it, you pass whatever web/native form inputs to it and render a big ole Formik and it gives you the magic, along with the error handling with the same type of names going on, and yup is like the schema library they like the best and have a special prop for, I dig it, aaand I’m tired and am going to bed. Good night!</p>\n<p>Best wishes! ~g</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: inline-block;\n    min-width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: inline-block;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-highlighted {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-background-color, transparent);\n    box-shadow: inset var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-width, 4px) 0 0 0 var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-color, transparent);\n  }\n  \n</style>","frontmatter":{"title":"Rock and Roll!","date":"March 24, 2020","description":"In which Gareth gets a good run in!"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/rock-and-roll/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/face-palm/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Face-Palm"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/do-the-work/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Do The Work!"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3786390493"]}
