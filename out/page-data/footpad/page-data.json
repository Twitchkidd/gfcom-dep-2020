Up at six, and after our first walk I brought Dawa to Harkness State Park where we get runs in and his little paws don’t have to be on concrete or asphault, and I can see improvement in the surface of his footpads! I’ve been keeping his runs on the sidewalk/road extremely limited and mostly running at Harkness for weeks now, after I noticed his footpads were really worn down and smooth, and very nearly blistered, though we avoided actual blistering thank goodness.</p>\n<p>Got a fair amount done after he was good and exercised, I took my laptop to Fort Trumbull and whipped up a few very small sample projects for HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Python, as I’m hoping to bring someone through why and how to use <code class=\"language-text\">master-blaster</code>! V. excite!</p>\n<p>Anyway, so then a salad happened for lunch and I ran nine miles barefoot, got groceries, took Dawa to the dog park and worked from there for a while, cooked for him, and now I’ve saved/uploaded what I was working on and am enjoying this beautiful evening on my patio here, with a beverage and snacks!</p>\n<p>How long does my back permit me so sit, is really the question behind whether I get any further work done this evening, lol.</p>\n<p>Thinking it’s going to be an extra-early day tomorrow, honestly I’m pretty worked for now. Pleasant evening out, though, my neighbor Ron the chef just walked by and said hello with his family, there’s a squirrel chillen out front, birds chirping, do like.</p>\n<p>Best wishes!\n~g</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: inline-block;\n    min-width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: inline-block;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-highlighted {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-background-color, transparent);\n    box-shadow: inset var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-width, 4px) 0 0 0 var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-color, transparent);\n  }\n  \n</style>","frontmatter":{"title":"Footpad","date":"July 15, 2020","description":"In which Gareth loses some, Dawa makes some gains though!"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/footpad/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/bike-ride!/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Bike Ride!"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/orthogonal-vibes/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Orthogonal Vibes"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3786390493"]}
