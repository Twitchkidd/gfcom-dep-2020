Woke up with the design solution for Logoed!</p>\n<p>Okay, been rocking and rolling for forty-five minutes here, getting auth going after sketching everything out, a question for later, can you have top-level contexts in a Gatsby app? Does that make sense? Oof, okay, copy and pasted the code in, need to walk the dog again before I can wire it up and test it out. //</p>\n<p>Oh, where are we? It’s been the type of day where I’m going back and forth between losing myself in the zone and getting annoyed that my dog isn’t using his little legs. Possibly haircut time for Dawa. Mostly I’ve been working on auth, which, like how much time have I spent on auth at this point, but I really feel like I’ve leveled up! And, so, haven’t gotten too far with like actually implementing the new design, and apparently there are other devs on the Logoed project now, which is pretty sweet, I gotta just bust this out real quick though.</p>\n<p>AHH I DID SO MUCH TODAY AND GOT SO FAR … AND IN THE END, IT DOESN’T REALLY MATTER? No, it does matter, I got so much further than I would have last year, and that’s what we’re looking for, but … oh my God, there are sounds coming from <strong>everywhere</strong> right now, and I can’t handle it …</p>\n<p>Best wishes, ~g.</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: inline-block;\n    min-width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: inline-block;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-highlighted {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-background-color, transparent);\n    box-shadow: inset var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-width, 4px) 0 0 0 var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-color, transparent);\n  }\n  \n</style>","frontmatter":{"title":"Terrapin","date":"March 27, 2020","description":"In which Gareth lets his inspiration flow!"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/terrapin/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/dahmbeyhrgeyhr/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Dahmbeyhrgeyhr!!"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/pandemic-humor/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Why Will Semicolons Be Everywhere In The Coming Months?"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3786390493"]}
